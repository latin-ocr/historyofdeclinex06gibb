the God of truth3 and called on the prophet Jesus himself to avenge
the impious mockery of his name and religion ²⁶. With inferior
numbers and disordered ranks, the king of Hungary rushed for-
wards in the confidence of victory, till his career was stopped by
the impenetrable phalanx of the Janizaries. If we may credit the
Ottoman annals, his horse was pierced by the javelin of Amurath ²⁷ ς
he fell among the spears of the infantry; and a Turkiss1 soldier pro-
claimed with a loud voice, “ Hungarians, behold the head of your
“ king !'' The death of Ladissaus was the signal of their defeat.
On his return from an intemperate pursuit‚ Huniades deplored his
error and the public loss: he strove to rescue the royal body, till he
was overwhelmed by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and van-

quiihed; and the last efforts of his courage and conduct were ex·-
erted to save the remnant of his Walachian cavalry. Ten thousand
Christians were ssain in the disastrous battle of Warna: the loss of
the Turks, more confiderable in numbers, bore a smaller proportion
to their total strength3 yet the philosophie sultan was not aihamed

where Ladissaus had fallen3 but the modest inscription, instead of
