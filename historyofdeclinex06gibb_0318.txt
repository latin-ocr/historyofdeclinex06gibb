daggers of his miffionaries were felt both in the East and West ε the
Christians and the MossemS enumerate, and perhaps multiply‚ the
illustrious victims that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, οι· re-

But these daggers, his only arum, were broken by the sword of
HolagOU, and not a vestige is left of the enemies of mankind, ex-

the phantom, it instantly vanished into smoke. After a siege of two
months, Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the Moguls ε and their
savage commander pronouneed the death of the caliph Mostasem,
the last of the temporal succeffors of Mahomet3 whose noble kins-
men, of the race of Abbas, had reigned in Afia above five hundred ’

years. Whatever might be the defigns of the conqueror, the holy
