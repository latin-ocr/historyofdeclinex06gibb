THE DECLINE AND FALL

“ It is indeed the will of God,” replied the pope; “ and let this
“ memorable word, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be for
“ ever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate thedevotion and
“ courage of the champions of Christ. His cross is the symbol of
“ your salvation ; wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an 'external mark
“ on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred ancl irre-
“ vocable ·engagement.” The proposal was joyfully accepted3 great
numbers both of the clergy and laity impreffed on their garments
‘the‘ fign of the cross¹³‚ and solicited the pope to march at their
head. This dangerous honour was declined by the more prudent
successor of Gregory, who alleged 'the schism of the church, and the
duties of his pastoral office, recommending to the faithful, who were
disqualified by sex or profeffion, by age or infirmity, to aid, with
their prayer-s and alms, the personal service of their robu‘st brethren.
The name and powersvof his legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop
The fore-
most of the tem poral chiefs was Raymond count of Thoulouse, whose
ambaffadors in the council excused the absence, and ‹pledged the
honour, of their master. After the confe'ffion and absolution of their
fins, the champions of the cross were dismissed with a superfluous
admonition to invite their countrymen and friends,; and their deff
parture for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the Assumption,

gold, or filk, or eloth, sewed on their gar-
ments. In the first crusade‚ all were red: in
the third, the French alone preserved that
colour, while green cross'es were adopted
by the Flemings, and white-by the English
(Ducange, tom ii. p. 651.). Yet in Eng-
land, the red ever appears the favoutite, and,
as it were, the national, colour of our military
enssgns and uniforms.

ginal writers of the crusades, adopt5‚ with

much compIacency, the fanatic title of Gui-

benus, Gesta Dm per Francos; though some
crities propose to read Gesta Diaboli per
Francos (Hanoviae, 161 ι, two vols. in folio).
