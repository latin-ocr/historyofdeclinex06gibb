minion5 but it was stipulated‚ that in forty days all the Franks and *-——-w-—-‘

Latin-s (hould evacuate Jerusalem, and be safely conducted to the
sea-ports of Syria and Egypt3 that tcn pieces of gold lhonld bc paid
for each man, five for each woman, and one for every child ; and
⁴that those who were unable to purchase their freedom should be de-
tained in perpetual ssavery. Of some writers it is a favourite and
invidious theme to compare the humanity of Saladin with the
maffacre of the first crusade. The difference would be merely per-
sona13 but we ffiould not forget that the Christiane, had offered to
capitulate, and that the Mahometans of Jerusalem sustained the last
.extremities of an affault and storm. ‚Justice is indeed due to the
fidelity with which the Turkilh conqueror fulfilled the conditione
of the treaty3 and he may be deservedly praised for the glance os
,pity which he cast on the misery of the vanquished. Instead of a
rigorous exaetion of his debt, he accepted a sum of thirty thousand
byzants, for the ransom of seven thousand poor ς two or three thou-
‚saud more were dismifl'ed by his gratuitous clemency; and the number
of ssaves was reduced to eleven or fourteen thousand persons. ,In-his
interview with the queen, his words, and even his tem-s, suggested

those who had been made orphans. or widows by the fortune of war3
and while the knights df the hospital were in arms against him, he
allowed their more pious brethren to continue, during the term of a
(year, the care and service of the ssek. In these adis of mercy the
virtue of Saladin deserves our admiration and love: he was above the
neceffity ofdiffimulation‚ and his stern fanaticisin would have prompted

him to diffemble, rather than to affe&3 this profane compaffion for the

enemies of the Koran. After Jerusalem had been delivered from the

presence of the strangers, the sultan made 'nis triumphant entry‚

‘his banners waving in the wind and to the harmony of martial

music, The great mosch of omar, which had been convertet} into
