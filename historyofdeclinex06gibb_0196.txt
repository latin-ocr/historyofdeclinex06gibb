ηε THE DEcmNE AND FALL

C H A P. lords of one fourth and a half of the Roman empire⁸. The doge,
ιὲέ-Ι-’.υ a ssave of state, was seldorn permitted to depart from the helm of
the republic ; but his place was supplied by the (mil or regent, who
exercised a supreme jurisdiction over the colony of Venetians: they
poss'effed three of the eight quarters of the city; and his inde-
pendent tribunal was composed of fix judges‚ four counsellors, two
chamberlains, two fiscal advocates, and a constable. Their long ex-
perience of the Eastern trade enabled them to sele& their portion
with discernment: they had rashly accepted the dominion and de-
fence of Adrianople; but it was the more reasonable aim of their·
policy to form a chain of faetories, and cities, and issands, along the
maritime coast, from the neighbourhood of Ragusa to the Hellespont
and the Bosphorus. The labour and eost of such extenslve con-
quests exhausted their treasury: they abandoned their maxims of
government‚ adopted a feudal system, and contented themselves with⁴
the homage of their nobles ⁹, for the poffeffions which these private ³

vaffals undertook to reduce and maintain. And thus it was, that

the family of Sanut acquired the dutchy of Naxos, which in-
volved the greatest part of the ArchipelagO. For the· price of ten*
thousand marks, the republic purchased of the marquis of Mont-
ferrat the fertile issand of Crete or Candia with the ruins of an.

marked the conquests made by the state or
nobles of Venice of the issands of Candia,
Cursu, Cephalonia, Zante, Naxos, Paros,
Melos, Andros, Mycone, Scyro, Cea, and
Lemnos.

p. 533.: but 1 cannot understand how it
could be his mother’s portion, or how she
could be the daughter of an emperor Alexius.

¹¹ In the year 1212, the doge Peter
Zani sent a colony to Candia, drawn from
every quarter of Venice. Butin their savage
manners and frequent rebessions, the Can-
diots may be compared to the Corficans
under the yoke of Genoa; and when 1 com-

pare the accounts of Belon and Tournef0rt,
1 cannot discern much difference between the
Venetian and the Turkissi issand.
