learned, that the ancient tribunes, so strong and sacred in the public
opinion, were not distinguished in style, habit, or appearance, from

political maxim of speaking to the eyes, as well as the understand-

handsome person³⁵‚ till it was swelled and disfigured by intem-
perance ; and his propenfity to laughter was correeoed in the magis—
trate by the affectation of gravity and sternness. He was cloathed‚ at

is remarkable, that the riso sarcastico of the
