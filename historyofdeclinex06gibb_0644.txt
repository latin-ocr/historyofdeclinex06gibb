626 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C gog P. of diverting into new channcls the Tyber itselfi or some of the de-

ι--Ὓ-τ-ι pendent streams, was-long opposed by superstition and local in·-

te-rests ¹⁶3 nor did the use compensate the toil and eost of the tardy
and imperfect execution. The servitude of rivers is the noblest and
most important vietory which man has obtained over the licentious-

7

ness of nature ¹ 3 and if such were the ravages of the Tyber under

a firm and affive government, what could oppose, or who can enu-
merate, the injuries of the city after the fall of the VVestern empire?
A remedy was at length produced by the evil itself: the accumula-
tion of rubbissi and the earth, that has been washed down from the
hills, is supposed to have elevated the plain of Rome, fourteen or
fifteen feet, perhaps, above the ancient level¹⁸ 3 and the modern city

is less acceflible to the attacks of the river ¹ .

ΙΙ. The II. The crowd of writers of every nation, who impute the de-

Ξξὲῂέᾟξῖἰ, have neglee’ted to enquire how far they were animated by an hostile

principle, and how far they poffeffed the means· and the leisure to
satiate their enmity. In the preceding volumes of this History, I
have described the triumph of barbarism and religion3 and Ican
only resume, in a few words, their real or imaginary connetffion with
the ruin of ancient Rome. Our fancy may create, or adopt, a
pleasing romance, that the Goths and Vandals sallied from Scandi-
navia, ardent το avenge the flight of Odin ²⁰, to break the chains,

¹⁶ Tacitus (Annal. i. 79.) reports the pe-
titions of the different toivns of Italy to the
senate against the measure3 and we may ap-
plaud the progress of reason. On a fimilar
occasion, local interests would nndoubeedly
be consulted: but an English house of com-
mons would reje& with contempt the argu-
ments of superstition, “ that nature had affign·
‘¹ ed to the rivers their proper course, &c.’'

observed this carious and unquestionable fact.
