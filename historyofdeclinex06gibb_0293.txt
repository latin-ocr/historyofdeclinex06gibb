(and magnificence, and both were equally fallacious. During the
late troubles, the treasures of the state, and even the furniture of the

He triumphed and reigned3 but his reign and triumph were clouded
by the discontent of his own and the adverse fa&ion. His followers
might style the general amnesty, an a& of pardon for his enemies,
and of oblivion for his friends³⁵ : in his cause, their estates had been
forfeited or plundered; and as they wandered naked and hungry
through the streets, they cursed the selfish generofity of a leader3
who, on the throne of the empire, might relinquish without merit
his private inheritance. The adherents of the empress blushed to
hold their lives and fortunes by the precarious favour of au usurper;
and the thirst of revenge was concealed by a tender concern for the
succeffion, and even the safety, of her son. They were justly
alarmed by a petition of the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might
be released from their oath of allegiance to the Palaeologi3 and en-
trusted with the defence of some cautionary towns ς a measure sup-
ported with argument and eloquence 3 and which was reje&ed (says
the Imperial historiam) “ by my sublime, aud almost incredible‚
