Christians spent on the verge of destruetiom and the proud lieu-
tenant of the caliph and the sultan left them only the choice of ser-
vitude or death ⁹³. In this extremity they conceced the relies of
their strength, sallicd from the town, and in a single memorable

the deliverers of the holy sepulchre, prepared themselves by a sober
and virtuous life for the daily contemplation of martyrdom. Ex·-
perience blows away this charitable illufion: and seldom does the

history of profane war display such scenes of intemperance and
prostitution as were exhibited under the walls of Antioch. The
