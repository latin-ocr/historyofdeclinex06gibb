sand dinars of gold. Bagdad was no lo‘nger the city of peace, the C gx& P.
seat of the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of Houlaeou could not κ--ψ-Ἀ
be overlooked by his ambitious successor. The whole course of the
Tigris and Euphrates, from the mouth to the sources of those rivers,
was reduced to his obedience: he entered Edessa ; and the Turk-
mans of the black sheep were chastised for the sacrilegious pillage of
a caravan of Mecca. In the mountains of Georgia, the native Chris-

tians still braved the law and the swerd of Mahomet3 by three ex-
peditions he obtained the merit of the gazie, or holy war; and the
Prince of Teflis became his proselyte and friend.

ΙΙ, A just retaliation might be urged for the invafion of Turkestan, 'iibrffefstan
or the eastern Tartary. The dignity of Timour could not endure A. D.’

the impunity of the Getes : he passed the Sihoon, subdued the king· ¹³⁷0-¹38³³
dom of Cashgar, and marched seven times into the heart of their

country. His most distant camp was two months journey, or four
hundred and eighty leagues to the north-east of Samarcand3 and his
emirs, who traversed the river Irtish, engraved in the forests of Si-
beria a rude memorial of their exploits. The conquest of Kipzak,
or the western Tartary ¹⁷, was founded on the double motive of aid-

ing the distreffed, and chastising the> un‘grateful. Todhtmish, a fu-
gitive prince, was entertained and proterit& in his court: the am-
baffadors of Auruss Khan were dismiffed with an haughty denia'l,
and followed on the same day by the armies of Zagatai ; and their
success establissred Todtamish in the Mogul empire of the north.

But after a reign of ten years, the new khan forgot the merits and
the strength of his benefa&or; the base usurper‚ as he deemed him,

poss'ess‘ed large territories both in Persia and and the Itineraries inserted in the i·t volume
Arabia; but they were at first the tributaries of Ramufio, of Ludovico Barthema (¹503)⁹
