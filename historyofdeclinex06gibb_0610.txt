592 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Θ H A P· from the castle of St. Angelo, implored the friendlhip of the king
x-LXv-Xss-a of Hungary at Naples, tempted the ambition of every bold adven-
turer‚ mingled at Rome with the pilgrims of the jubilee, lay con-
cealed among the hermits of the Apennine‚ and wandered through
the cities of Italy, Germany, and Bohemia. His person was in-
visible, his name was yet formidable; and the anxiety of the court
of Avignon supposes, and even magnifies, his personal merit. The
emperor Charles the fourth gave audience to a stranger, who
frankly revealed himself as the tribune of the republic; *and asto-
niffled an affembly of ambaffadors and princes, by the eloquence

of a patriot and the vifions of a prophet, the downfal of tyranny
and the kingdom of the Holy Ghost³¹. Whatever had been his
hopes, Rienzi found himself a captive3 but he supported a charaeter

into the city was that of a malefactor ; in his prison he was chained
by the leg ; and four cardinals were named to enquire into the crimes
of heresy and rebellion. But his trial and condemnation would have
involved some questions, which it was more prudent to leave under
the veil of mystery: the temporal supremacy of the popes; the
duty of residence3 the civil and ecclefiastical privileges of the clergy
and people of Rome. The reigning pontiff well deserved the ap·

pellation of Clement .· the strange viciffitudes and magnanimous spirit
of the captive excited his pity and esteem3 and Petrarch believes

enemies of Rienzi seem alike ignorant, are that the tyranny ofthe pope would be aboliffi-
