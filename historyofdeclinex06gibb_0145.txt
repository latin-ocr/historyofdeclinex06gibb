OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

was lharpened by sceret envy of the bold and pious enterprises of the
Franks. But these profane causes of national enmity were fortified
and inflamed by the venom of religious zeal. Instead of a kind em-
brace, an hospitable reception from their Christian brethmn of the
East, every tongue was taught to repeat the names of schismatis and
hei-etio, more odious to an orthodox ear than those of pagan and
infidel: instead of being loved for the general conformity of saith
and worship, they were abhorred for some rules of discipline, some
questions of theology, in which themselves or their teaehers might
differ from the Oriental church. In the crusade of Louis the seventh‚
the Greek elergy washed and purified the altars which had been
defiled by the sacrifice of a French priest. The companions of Fre-
derie Barbaroffa deplore the injuries which they endured, both in
word and deed, from the peculiar rancour of the bishops and monks.
Their prayers and sermons excited the people against the impioue
Barbarians3 and the patriarch is accused of declaring, that the faith-
ful might obtain the redemption of all their sms by the extirpation
of the schismatics ¹². An enthufiast, named Dorotheus, alarmed the
fears, and restored the confidence, of the emperor, by a prophetie
affurance, that the German heretic, after affaulting the gare of Bla-
chernes, would be made a fignal example of the divine vengeance0
The passage of these mighty armies were rare and perilo'us events 3.
but the crusades introduced a frequent and familiar intercourse be-
tween the two natione, which enlarged their knowledge, without
abating their prejudice& The wealth and luxury of Constantinople
