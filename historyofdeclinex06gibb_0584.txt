THE DECLINE AND FALL

tary feud, which distraeted above two hundred and fifty years the
ecclefiastical state. The jealousy of pre-eminence and power was the
true ground of their quarrel ; but as a specious badge of distinction,
the Colonna embraced the name of Ghibelines and the party of the
empire3 the Urfini espoused the title of Guelphs and the cause of
the church. The eagle and the keys were displayed in their adverse
banners; and the two factions of Italy most furioussy raged when
the origin and nature of the dispute were long since forgotten¹⁰⁷.
After the retreat of the popes to Avignon, they disputed in arms the
vacant reipublic: and the mischiefs of discord were perpetuated by
the wretched compromise of eleeting each year two rival senators.
By their private hostilities, the city and country were desolated‚ and
the fluctuating balance inclined with their alternate success· But none
of either family had fallen by the sword, till the most renowned
champion of the Urfini was surprised and ssain by the younger
Stephen Colonna¹⁰⁵. His triumph is stained with the reproach of
violating the truce 3 their defeat was basely avenged by the affaffina-
tion, before the church door, of an innocent boy and his two ser-
vants. Yet the victorious Colonna, with an annual colleague, wa’s
declared senator of Rome during the term of five years. And the
muse of Petrarch inspired a with, a hope, a prediction, that the ge-
nerous youth, the son of his venerable hero, would restore Rome and
Italy to their pristine glory3 that his justice would extirpate the
wolves and lions, the serpents and bears, who laboured to subvert
the eternal basis of the marble COLUMN ¹⁰⁹.
