or THE RoMAN EMPIRE„

prineipal establissnnent of Caffa⁴⁸ was befieged without effe& by the
Tartar powers. Destitute of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by
these haughty merchants, who fed, or famissietl, Constantinople‚
according to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs,
the fishery, and even the toll, of the Bosphorus3 and while they
derived from these objects a revenue of two hundred thousand picces
of gold, a temnant of thirty thousand was relustantly allowed to
the emperor ⁴⁹. The colony of Pera or Galata acted, in peace and
war, as an independent state; and, as it will happen in distant set-
tlements, the Genoese podesta too often forgot that he was the ser-
vant of his own masters.

These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder
Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflieted his age and the mi-
nority of his grandson. The talents of Cantacuzene were employed
to the ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire3 and after
his domestic victory, he was condemned to an ignominious trial,
whether the Greeks or the Genoese should reign in Constantinople.
The merchants of Pera were offended by, his refusal of some conti-
y guous lands, some commanding heights, which they proposed to
· cover with new fortifications3 and in the absence of the emperor,

who was detained at Demotica by fickness, they ventured to brave
the debility of a female reign. A Byzantine veffel, which had pre-

sumed to fifh at the mouth of the harbcur, was sunk by these auda·
cious strangers 3 the fistrermen were murdered. Instead of suing for
pardon‚ the Genoese demanded satisfaction3 required in an haughty
strain‚ that the Greeks should renounce the exercise of navigation;
and encountered with regular arms the first sallies of the popular in-
dignation. They instantly occupied the debateable land ; and by
the labour of a whole people, of either sex and of every age, the
