and the hereditary, as well as personal, merit of Otho Colonna recom-

mended him to the conclave. Rome accepted with joy and obedience
the noblest of het· sons, the ecelefiastical state was defended by his
powerful family, and the elevation of Martin the fifth is the aera of
the restoration and establishment of the popes in the Vatican⁷⁶.

The royal prerogative of coining money, which had been exercised
near three hundred years by the senate, was first resumed by Mart'm
the fifth⁷⁷, and his image and superscription introduce the series of the

papal medals.

⁷⁵ Ι cannot overlook this great national
cause, which was vigoroussy maintained by
the English ambass'adors against those of
France. The latter conoended, that Christen-
dom was effentially distributed into the four
great nations and votes, of Italy, Germany,
France, and Spain; and that the less'er king-
doms (such as England, Denmark, Portu-
gal, &c.) were comprehended under one or
other of these great divisions. The English
asserted, that the British issands, of which
they were the head, should be considered as
a fifth and co-ordinate nation‚ with an equal
vote; and every argument of truth or fable
was introduced to exalt the dignity of their
country. Including England, scotland,
Wales, the four kingdoms of Ireland, and
the Orknies, the British issands are decorated
with eight royal crowns‚ and discriminated
by four or five languages, English, Welffi,
Cornish, Scotch, Irish, &c. The greater
issand from north to south measures 800
miles, or 40 daysjourney3 and England alone
contains 32 enunties, and 52‚000 parish
chmehes, (a bold accountl) besides cathe-
drals, colleges, priories, and hospitals. They
celebrate the mission of St. Joseph of Arima-
thea, the birth os Constantine, and the le-
gantine powers of the two primates, without
forgetting the testimony of Bartholemy de
Glanville (A.D. 1360), who reckons only
four Christian kingdoms, 1. of Reme, 2. of

Constantinople‚ 3. of Ireland, which had
been transferred to the English mouarchs,
and, 4. of Spain. Our countrymen pre-
vailed in the council, but the viciories of
Henry V. added much weight to their argu—
ments. The adverse pleadings were found
at Constance by Sir Robert Wingfield, am-
baffador from Henry VIII. to the emperor
Maximilian Ι. and by him printed in ¹5¹7
at Louvain. From a Leipfic MS. they are
more correc'tly published in the Colleffion of
Von der Hardt, tom. v.; but Ι have only seen
Lenfant's abstrait of these afts (Concile de
Constance, tom. ii. p. 447. 433, &c.).

⁷⁶ The histories of the three succesiive
councils, Pisa, Constante, and Bafil, have
been written with a tolerable degree of can-
dour, industry, and elegance, by a Protestant
minister, M. Lenfant‚ who retired from
France to Berlin. They form fix volumes in
quarto; and as Bafil is the worst‚ so Con-
stance is the best, part of the colleffion.

and the Baton de la Bastie. The Metallie
History of Martin V. and his succeffors, has
been composed by two monks, Moulinet a
Frenchman, and Bonanni an Italian: but 1
understand, that the first part of the series is
restored from more recent coins.
