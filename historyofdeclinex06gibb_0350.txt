THE DECLINE AND FALL

But these cares were in-

x-v-..a effeetual for the preservation of his fame, and these precious memo-

rials in the Mogul or Perfian language were concealed from the
world, or at least from the knowledge of Europe. The nations
which he vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge3 and
ignorance has long repeated the tale of calumny⁵, which had dis-
. figured the birth and chara&er‚ the person, and even the name, of
Tamerlane ⁰. Yet his real merit would be enhanced, rather than de-
based, by the elevation of a peasant to the throne of Afia; nor can
his lameness be a theme of reproach, unless he had the weakness
to blulh at a natural, 01· perhaps an honourable, infirmity.

In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeafible succeffion of
the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject3 yet he spi-ang

English transsation and most valuable index,

joint labours of Major Davy‚ and Mr.White
the Arabic professor. This work has been

entalist‚ who has added the life of Tin-nour,

relies on their internal evidence: but if any
suspicions should arise of fraud and fistion,
they will not be dispelled by Major Davy⁷s
letter. The Orientals have never cultivated
the art of criticism; the patronage of a
prince, less honour-able perhaps, is not less
lucrative than that of a bookseller: nor can
