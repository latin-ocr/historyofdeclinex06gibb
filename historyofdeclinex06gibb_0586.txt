his graver contemporaries, his love was a sin, and Italian verse a
frivolous amusement. His Latin works of philosophy, poetry, and
eloquence, established his ferious=reputation, which was soon diffused
from Avignon over France and Italy : his friends and disciples were
mui'tipl'ied in every city ; and if the ponderous volume of his writ-
ings⁶ be now abandoned to a long repose, our gratitude must ap-
pland the man, who by precept and example revived the spirit
and study of the Augustam age. From his earliest youth, Petrarch
aspired to the poetic erown. The academical honours of the
three faculties had introduced a royal degree of master or doetor in
the art of poetry⁷3 and the title of poet-laniem, which custom,
rather than vanity‚ perpetuates in the English court ⁸, was first in-

one of these -is issued, in the tenth degree,
the abbe de Sade, the fond and grateful
biographer of Petrarch; and this domestic
motive most probably suggested the idea of
his work, and urged him to enquire into every
circumstance that could affe& the history and
