each stranger, a monthly allowance was affigned of three or four AE‘L
gold florins; and although the entire sum did not amount to seven
hundred florius, a long arrear was repeatedly incurred by the indi-
gence or policy of the Roman court ⁵⁹. They fighed for a speedy
deliverance, but their escape was prevented by a triple chain: a.
paffport from their superiors was required at the gates of Ferrara3
the governtnent of Venice had engaged to arrest and send back the
fugitives; and inevitable punishment awaited them at Constanti-
nople3 excommunication, fines, and a sentence, which did not re-

spe& the sacerdotal dignity, that they should be stripped naked and

publicly whipped⁶⁰. It was only by the alternative of hunger or
dispute that the Greeks could be persuaded to open the first confer-
ence ς and they yielded with extreme reluctanee to attend from
Ferrara to Florence the rear of a flying synod. This new transsation
was urged by inevitable neceffity: the city was visited by the plague3
⁴ the fidelity of the marquis might be suspected 3 the mercenary
troops of the duke of Milan were at the gate33 and as they occupied
Romagna, it was not without difficulty and danger that the pope,
the emperor, and the* bishops, explored· their way through the unfre-
quented paths of the Apennine ⁶¹.

Yet all these obstacles were surmounted by tIme and' policy. The

violence of the fath-ers of Basil' rather promoted‘ than injured the

culty, that instead os provisions, money
should be distributed‚ four florius per month
to the persons of honourable rank, and three
florina to their servants, with an addition of
thirty more to the emperor, twenty-,five to
the patriarch, and twenty to the prince or
despot Demetrius. The payment ofthe first
month amounted to 691 ss'orins, a sum which
will not allow us to reekon above 200 Greeks
of every condition (Syropulus, p. 104, 105.).
On the 20⁸¹ october 1438, there was an
arrear of four month55 in April 1439, of

three; and of fi-ve and a half in July, at the
time of the union(p·172. 2²5· 27¹·)·

plores the imprisonment of the Greeks, and.
the tyranny of the emperor and patriarch.

⁶¹ The wars of Italy are most clearly re-
presented in the xiii‘h volume of the Annals
of Muratori. The schismatie Greek, Syro-
pulus (p. ¹43·)› appears to have exaggerated
the sear and disorder of the pope in his re-
treat from Ferrara to Florence, which is
proved by the asss to have been somewhat
more decent and deliberares
