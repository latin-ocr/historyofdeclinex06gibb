OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

belly of one of his chamberlains was cut open, on a complaint
against him for drinking the gons-milk of a poor woman. ‘l'he
strangers were astonilhed by this a& of justice; but it was the justice
of a sultan who disdains to balance the weight of evidence or
to measure the degrees of guilr.

After his enfranchisement from an oppreffive guardian, John Pa-
laeologus remained thirty-six years, the helpless, and as it should
seem, the careless, speetator, of the public ruin⁶⁶. Love, or rather
lust, was his only viborous passion ; and in the embraces of the wives
and virgins os the city, the Tu1-ki1h ssave forgot the dishonour of the
emperor of the Romans. Andronicus, his eldest son, had formed, at
Adrianople, an intimate and guilty friendship with Sauzes the son of
Amurath; and the two youths conspired against the authority and
lives of their parents. The presence of Amurath in Europe soon
discovered and diffipated their rash counsels 3 and, after depriving
Sauzes of his sight, the Ottoman threatened his vafl'al with the treat-
ment of an accomplice and an enemy, unless he inflie‘ced a fimilar
punishment on his own son. Palaeologus trembled and obeyed;
and a cruel precaution involved in the same sentence the childhood
and innocence of John the son of the criminal. But the operation
was so mildly, or so unskilfully, performed, that the one retained
the fight of an eye, and the other was afflioed only with the in-
firmity of squinting. Thus exeluded from the succeffion, the two
princes were confined in the tower of Anema3 and the piety of
Manuel, the second son of the reigning monarch, was rewarded with
the gift of the Imperial crown. But at the end of two years, the
turbulence of the Latins and the levity of the Greeks produced a
revolution; and the two emperors vvere buried in the tower from
