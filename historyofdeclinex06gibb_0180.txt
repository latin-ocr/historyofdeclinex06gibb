THE DECLINE AND FALL

he was poisoned, or strangled, or beaten with clubs, at the command,
and in the presence, of the tyrant. The emperor Isaac Angelus
soon followed his son to the grave, and Mourzoufle, perhaps, might
spare the superfluous crime of hastening the extitifiion of impotcnce
and blindness.

The death of the emperors, and the usurpation of Mourzoufle, had
changed the nature of the quarrel. It was no longer the disagreement
of allies who over-valued their services, or negledted their obligations :
the French and Venetians fot-got their complaints against Alexins,
dropt a tear on the untimely fate of their companion, and swore re-

venge against the perfidious nation who had crowned his affaffin.
Yet the prudent doge was still inclined to negociate3 he asked as a

debt, a substdy, or a fine, fifty thousand pounds of gold, about two
millions sterling; nor would the conference have been abruptly
broken, if the zeal, or policy, of Mourzoufle had not refused to sa-
crifice the Greek church to the safety of the state⁷⁷. Amidst the in·-
vectives of his foreign and domestic enemies, we may discern, that
he was not unworthy of the character which he had assumed, of
the public champion: the second siege of Constantinople was far
more laborious than the firs't3 the treasury was replenilhed, and
discipline was restored, by a severe inquisition into the abuses of the
former reign; and Mourzoufle, an iron mace in his hand, vifiting
the posts, and afseffiling the port and aspe& of a warrior, was an ob-
je& of terror, to his soldiers‚ at least, and to his kinsmen. Before
and after the death of Alexius, the Greeks made two vigorous and
well-conducted attempts to burn the navy in the harbour; but the

skill and courage of the Venetians repulsed the fire-ship83 and the
‚vagrant flames wasted themselves without injury in the sea ⁷⁸. In a
