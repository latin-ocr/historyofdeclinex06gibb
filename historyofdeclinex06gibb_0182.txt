council‚ appi-ehenfive only for the public danger: not a voice pro-
nounced the words of escape or treaty3 and each warrior, according
to his temper, embraced the hope of victory or the assurance of a
glorious death ⁸⁰. By the experience of the former siege, the Greeks
were instrudted, but the Latins were animated ; and the knowledge,
that Constantinople might be taken, was of more avail than the local
precautions which that knowledge had inspired forits defence. In
the> third affault, two ships were linked together to double their
strength3 a strong north wind drove them on the ssiore3 the bishops
of Troyes and Soiffons led the van3 and the auspicious names of
the pilgrim and the pazradfst resounded along the line⁸¹. The epi-
scopal banners were displaycd on the walls; an hundred marks of
filver had been promised to the first adventurers3 and if their reward
was intercepted by death, their names have been immortalised by
fame. Four towers were scaled ; three gates were burst open 3 and
the Freneh knights, who might tremble on the waves, felt them-
selves invincible on horseback on the solid ground. Shall Ι relate
that the thousands who guarded the emperor's person fied on the
approach and before the lance of a smgle warrior? Their ignomi-
nious flight is attested by their countryrnan Nicetas; an army of
phantoms marched with the Freneh hero, and he was magni-fied to

a giant in the eyes of the Greeks⁸². While the fugitives deserted
their posts and cast away their arms, the Latins entered the city
under the banners of their leaders 3 the streets and gates opened for

arridere poterat. Yet the knight despises
those who thought of flight, and the monk
praises his countrymen who were resolved on
death.

calls him {ma οργωας, nine orgyae, or eighteen
yards high, a stature which would indeed
have excused the terror of the Greek. On
this occasion, the historian seems fouder of
the mai-vellens, than of his country, or per-
haps of truth. Baldwin exclaims in the words
of the psalmist, persequitur unus ex nobis
