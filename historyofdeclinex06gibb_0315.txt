and actions are often conspicuous in the history of his conquests.

Firmly united for their own and the public interest, the three

brothers and their families were content with dependent sceptres;

and Octai, by general consent, was proclaimed great khan, or ein-—

peror of the Moguls and Tartars. He was succeeded by his son
Gayuk, after whose death the empire devolved to his coufins Man-
gou and Cublai, the sons of Tuli, and the grandsons of Zingis. In
the sixty-eight years of his four first succeffors, the Mogul subdued
almost all Asta, and a large portion of Europe. Without confining
myself to the order of time, without expatiating on the detail of
events, I shall present a general picture of the progress of their

been dismembered by Zingis, was finally subdued seven years after
his death. After the loss of Pekin, the emperor had fixed his re-
fidence at Kaifong, a city many leagues in circumference, and which
contained, according to the Chinese anmals, fourteen hundred thou-

with only seven horsemen, and made his last stand in a third capital,

²¹ Zagatai gave his name to his domi-
nions of Maurenahar, or Transoxian33 and
the Moguls of Hindostan, who emigrated
from that country, are styled Zagatais by the
Perfians. This certain etymology, and the
fimilar example of Uzbek, Nogai, &c. -may
warn us not absolutely to reject the deriva-
tions ofa national‚ from a personat, name.
