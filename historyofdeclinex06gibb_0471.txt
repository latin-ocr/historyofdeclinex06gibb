fcar and fly without shame; and his military life is composed of
a romantic alternative of vi&01··1es and escapes. By the Turks, who
employed his name to firighten their perverse children, he was cor-

proof of their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was inae-2
ceffible to their arms5 andthey felt him most daring and. formi-

four years after the defeat* of VVarna he again penetrated i'nto the
heart of Bulgari'a3 and in the plain of Coffova sustained, till the

who had triurnphed over his armS. On the first vacancy of the
throne, Matthias· Corvinus, a youth of eighteen years-of age, was
elected· and. crowned by the grateful Hungarians.. His reign was
