and many thousands‚ in the month of November, ere&ed their tents

or huts in the open field. A seflion of eight days produced some

useful or edifying canons for the reformation of manners; a severe
censure was pronounced against the licence of private war 3 the truce
of God ¹⁶ was confirmed, a suspenfion of hostilities during four days
of the week3 women and priests were placed under the safeguard of
the church 3 and a proteffilion of three years was extended to husband-
men and merchants, the defenceless viitims of military rapine. But
a law, however venerable be the sanction, cannot* suddenly transform
the temper of the times; and the benevolent efforts of Urban deserve
the less praise, since he laboured to appease some domestic quarrels

that he might spread the flames of war from the Atlantic to the
Euphrates. From the synod of Placentia, the rumour of his great

defign had gone forth among the nations : the clergy on their return
had preached in every diocese the merit and glor-y of the deliverance
of the Holy Land ; and when the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in
the market-place of clermont, his eloquence was addreffed to a well
prepared and impatient audience. His topics were obvious, his ex-

hortation was vehement, his success inevitable. The orator was

interrupted by the shout of thousands‚ who with* one voice, and in
their rustic idiom', exclaimed aloud, “ God vvills it, God wills it ¹⁷.”

¹⁶ The Truce of God (Treva, or· Treuga
Dei) was first invented in Aqustain, A.D.
103z; blamed by some bishops as an occa-
s10n cf perjury‚ and rejeffted by the Normaus
as contrary ιο their privileges (Ducange,
Gloss'. Latin. tom.vi. p. &qa-685).

¹⁷ Deus vult, Deus vult! was the pure

illiterate laity, who spoke the Provincial οτ
Limoqfin idiom, it was corrupted to Deus Io
volt, or Diex el volt. See Chron. Cafinense,
1. iv. c.11. p. 497. in Muramri, Script.
Rerum Ital. tom.iv. and Ducange (Differrat.
xi. p. 207. sur Joinville‚ and Gloss‘. Latin.
tom. ii. p. 690.), who, in his preface, pro-
duces a very> difficolt specimen of the diale&
of Rovergue, A. D. 1100, very near, both in
time and place, to the council of Clermont
