THE DECLINE AND FALL

The hilly country beyond the Tigris is occupied hythe pastoral
tribes of the Curds ⁴⁶ :

the yoke, addieted to rapine, and tenacioris of the government of

a peoplc hardy, strong, savage, impatient of
their national chiefs. The resemblance of name, situation, and man-
nerS, seem to identify them with the Carduchians of the Greeks ⁴⁷ 3
and they still defend against the Ottornan Porte the antique freedom
which they afferted against the successors of Cyrus. Poveity and
ambition prompted them to embrace the profeffion of⁸mercenary
soldiers: the service of his father and uncle prepared the reign of the
great Saladin ⁴⁸3 and the son of Job or Ayub, a fimple Cui-d, mag-
nanimoussy smiled at his pedigree‚ which flattery deduced from
the Arabiam caliplis49. So unconscious was Noureddin of the
impending ruin of his house, that he constrainetl the reluctant
youth to follow his uncle Shiracouh into Egypt: his military cha-
racter was established by the defence of Alexandria3 and if We may
believe the Latius, he solicited and obtained from the Christian ge-
neral the profane honours of knighthood ⁵³. On the death of Shira-
couh, the office of grand vizir was bestowed on Saladim as the
youngest and least powerful of the emirs3 but with the advice of
his father, whom he invited to Cairo, his genius obtained the

sinuated‚ that their descen( was only on the
mother’s fide, and that their :incestor was a
stranger who settled among the Curds.

Xenophon. The ten thousand suffered more
from the arrows of the free Carduchians, than
from the splendid weakncss of the great
king.

⁴⁸ We are indebted to the professor Schul-
tens (Lugd. Bar. 1755, in folio) for the

richcsl :ind most authentic materials, alife of
Saladin by his friend and minister the Cadhi
Bohadffi, and copious extraRs from the history
of his kinsrnan the prince Abulfeda of Ha-
mah. To these we may add, the article of
Salaheddin in the Bibliotheque Orientale,
and all that may be gleaned from the Dy-
nasties ofAbulpharagius.

4⁹ Since Abulfeda was himself an Ayou-
bite‚ he may share the praise, fo’r imstming,
at least tacitly, the modesty of the founder.

Francos, p.1152. A similar example may
be found in Joinville (p. 4²· edition du Lou-
vre); but the pious St. Louis refused to dig-
nify infidels with the order of Christian
knig'nthood (Ducange, Observadons, p.70.).
