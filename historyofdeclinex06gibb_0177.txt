sacrilege. During the absence of marquis Boniface and his Imperial
pupil, Constantinople was visited with a calamity which might be
justly imputed to the zeal and indiscretion of the Flemish pilgrims⁷³.
In one of their visits to the city, they were scandalized by the aspefl:
of a mosch or synagogae, in which one God was worshipped, without
a partner or a son. Their effeetual mode of controversy was to at-
