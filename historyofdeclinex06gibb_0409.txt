perhaps instmffi-ve, to contemplate the rude pidhwes of Cei-many,
France, and England, whose ancient and modern state are so fa-

is ofample latitude from Vienna to the Ocean3 and it stretches (a
strange geography) from Prague in Bohemia to the river Tartessos,
and the Pyrenaean mountains²³. The soil, except in fige and olives,
is sufficiently fruitful; the airis salubrious 3 the bodies of the natives
are robust and healthy3 and these cold regions are seldom visited
with the calamities of pestilence‚ οι· earthqnakes. After the Scythians
or Tamus, the Germans are the most numerous of nations; they
are brave and patient, and were they united under a fingle head,
their force would be irrefistible. By the gift of the pope, they have
acquired the privilege of chufing the Roman emperor²⁴; nor is any
people more devontly attached to the saith and obedienee of the
Latin patriarch. The greatest part of the country is divided among
the princes and prelate53 but Strasburgh, Cologne, Hamburgh‚ and
more than two hundred free cities, are governed by fage and equal
laws, according to the will, and for the advantage, of thesswhole
community. The use of duels, οι· single combats on f00t‚ prevaiis
