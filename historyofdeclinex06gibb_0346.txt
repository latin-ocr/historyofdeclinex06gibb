328 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 1213} P. whence the two prisoners were exalted to the throne. Another period

κῆρ-...α of two years afforded Palaeologus and Manuel the means of escape:
it was contrived by the magio, or subtlety, of a monk, who was
alternately named the angel or the devil : they fied to Scutari3 their
