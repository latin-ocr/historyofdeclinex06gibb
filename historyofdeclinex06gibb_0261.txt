OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

policy of Michael‚ who depofited a plenteous store of corn and salt
provisions, to sustain the fiege which he might hourly expe& from
the resentment of the Western powers. Of these, the sovereign of
the two Sicilies was the most formidable neighbour ; but as long as
they were poffeffed by Mainfroy, the bastard of Frederic the second,-
his monarchy was the bulwark rather than the annoyance of the
Eastern empire. The usurper, though a brave and aestive prince,
was sufficiently employed in the defence of his throne : his proscrip-
tion by succeffive popes had separated Mainfroy from the common
cause of the Latins; and the forces that might have besieged Con-
stantinople, were detained in a crusade against the domestic enemy
of Rome. The prize of her avenger, the crown of the two Sicilies'»
was won and worn by the brother of St. Loui's, by charles count of
Anjou and Provence, who -led the chivalry of France on this holy
expedition ³⁷. The disaffeffion of his Christian subjeets compelled
Mainfroy to enlist a colonyof Saracens whom his father had planted
in Apulia: and this odious succour will explain the defiance of the
Catholic here, who rejedted all terms of accommodatiori. “ Bear

“ and the sword are umpire- between us; and that he thau either
“ send me to paradise, or Ι will send him to the pit of hell.’' The
armies met, and though I am ignorant of Mainfroy’s doom in the
other world, in this he lost his friends, his kingdom, and his life, in
the bloody battle of Benevento. Naples and Sicily were immediately
peopled with a warlike race of French nobles 3 and their aspiring
leader embraced the future conquest of Africa, Greece, and Pales-
titie. The most specious reasons might point his first arms against
the Byzantine empire 3 and Palaeologus, diffident of his own strength,
