012 THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 615

except in an hasty quai-rel, when the vicar of Christ and the Turkish Ο {³50}ss P·
sultan were armed at the same time against the kingdom of k--v-—J
Naples⁹¹. The French and Gcrmans at length withdrew from the
field of battle: Milan, Naples‚ Sicily, Sardinia, and the sea-coast
of Tuscany, were firmly posseffed by the Spaniam-(153 and it·became
their interest to maintain the peace and dependence of Italy, which
continued almost without disturbance from the middle of the six-
teenth to the opening of the eighteenth century. The Vatican was
svvayed and protected by the religious policy of the Catholic king:
his prejudice and interest disposed him in every dispute to support
the prince against *the people; and instead of the encouragement‚
the aid, and the asylum, which they obtained from the adjacent
states, the friends of liberty, or the enemies of law, were enclosed
on all fides within the iron circle of despotism. The long habits of
obedience and education subdued the turbulent spirit of the nobles
and commons of Rome. The barons fcrgot the arms and faciions
of their ancestors‚ and insenfibly became the servants of luxury and
government. Instead of maintaining a crowd of tenants and fol-
lowers, the produce of their estates vvas consumed in the private
expences, Which multiply the pleasures, and diminish the power, of
the lord ⁹². The Colonna and Ursini vied with each other in the
decoration of their palaces and chapels 3 and their antique splendour
was rivalled or surpaffed by the sudden opulence of the papal fami-
lies. In Rome the voice of freedom and discord is no longer heard ;
and, instead of the foaming torrent, a smooth and stagnant lake

reflects the image of idleness and servitude.

⁹¹ The ambitione and feeble hostilities os
the Caraffa pope, PaulIV. may be seen in
Thnanus (l. xvi-xviii.) and Giannone
‘torm iv. p. 149—163.). Those Catholic
bigots‚ Philip 11. and the duke of Alva,
presumed to separate the Roman prince from
the vicar of Christ: yet the holy chax-adler,
which would have sanctified his victory, was

16

decently applied to prote& his defeat.

⁹² This gradual change of manners and
expence, is admirably explained by Dr.Adam
Smith (Wealth of Nations, vol. i. p. 495-
504.)‚ who proves, perhaps too severely,
that the most salu·tary effefls have flowed
from the meauest and most selfifh causes.
