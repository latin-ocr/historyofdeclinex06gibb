4 THE ‘DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. Ravenna, who contended with Urban for the name and honours.
„Q of the pontificate. He attempted to unite the powers of the west,
at a time when the princes were separated from the church, and the

people from their princes, by the excommunication which himself

and his predeceffors had thundered against the emperor and the king

’ of France. Philip the first, of France, supported with patience the

censures which¹ he had provoked by his scandalous life and adulte-

rous marriage. Henry the fourth, of Germany, afferted the right

of investitur-es, the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the de-

livery of the ring and crofier. But the emperor's party was crushed

in Italy by the arms of the Normans and the countess Mathilda ς’

and the long quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of

his son Conrad and the shame of his wife ⁵, who, in the synods of
Constance and Placentia, confeffed the manifold prostitutions to

which she had been exposed by an husband regardless of her honour
and his own ⁶. So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was!
his influence, that the council which he summoned at Placentia⁷
was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgundy,
Swabia, and Bavaria. Four thousand of' the clergy, and thirty
thousand of the laity‚ attended this important meeting3 and, as the
most spacious cathedral would have, been inadequate to 'the multi*-
tude, the session of seven. days was held in a· plain adjacent to the

quod ipsam tantas spurcitias non tam commis-
fisse quam invitam pertulisse pro certo cog-
noverit papacum sanciri synodo. Apud Baron.

⁵ She is known by the different names of
Praxes, Eupraecia‚ Eustasia, and Adelais;
and was the daughter osa Ruffian prince, and

the widow of a margrave of Brandenburgh.

⁶ Henricus odio cam coepit habere: ideo
incarceravitDeam, et conceffit ut plerique vim
ei inferrem immo filium hortans ut eam
subagitaret (Dodechin, Continuat. Marian.
Scot. apud Baron. A.D. 1093. N04.). In
the synod of Constance, she is described by
Bert-holdus, rerum inspector: quae se tantas
et tam inauditas fornicationum spurcitias,et a
tantis passam fuiss'e conquesta est, διε. and again
at Placentia: satis misericorditer suscepit, eo

A.D. 1093, N04. ¹094⁷ N03. A rare sub-

je& for the infallible decifion of a pope and

council. These abominations are repugnant
to every principle of human nature, which
is not altered by a dispute about rings
and crofiers„ Yet it should seem, that the
wretched woman was tempted by the priests

to relate οι· subscribe sorne infamous stories of
herself and her husband.

of Placentia, Concil. tom. xii. p. 821, Sec.
