OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 291

and every labour was servile except the proseffion of arms. The C glus> Ρ-
service and discipline of the troops, who were armed with bows, ι--ν---Ι
scymetars, and iron maces, and divided by hundreds, thousands, and
ten thousands‚ were the institutione of a veteran commander. Each
officer and soldier was made responsible, under pain of death,
for the safety and honour of his compani01153‘ and the spirit of con-
quest breathed in the law, that peace should never be granted unless
to a vanquished and suppliant enemy. But it is the religion of
Zingis that best deserves our wonder and applause. The Catholic
inquifitors of Europe, who defended nonsense by cruelty, might have

been confounded by the example of a Barbarkm, who anticipated
the leffons of philosophy ⁶, and established by his laws a system of
pure theism and perse& toleration. His first and only article of
faith was the existence of one God‚ the author of all good ; who
fills by his presence the heavens and earth, which he has created
by his power. The Tartars and Moguls were addieted to the idols
0ss their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by
the foreign miffionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahornet, and
of Christ. These various systems in freedorn and concord, were
taught and prafflsed within· the precind‘cs of the same camp3 and
the Bonie, the Imam, the Rabbf, the Nestorian and the Latin
priest, enjoyed the same honourable exemption from service and
tribute : in the mosch of Bochara, the insolent vietor might trample
the koran under his horses feet, but the calm legissator respected the
prophets and pontiffs of the most hostile sens. The reason of Zingis
was not informed by books ; the khan could neither read nor write3
and, except the tribe of the Igours, the greatest part of the Moguls
and Tartars were as illiterate as their sovereigu. The memory of
