nous troops, Constantine was compelled to despoil the churches with
the promise of a fourfold restituti0n3 and his sacrilege offered a new
reproach to the enemies of the union. A spirit of discord impaircd
the remnant of the Christian strength: the Genoese and Venetian
auxiliaries afferted the pre-eminence of their respetffive service ; and
Justiniani and the great duke‚ whose ambition was not extinguished
by the common danger, accused each other of treachery and cow-
ardice.

During the siege of Constantinople‚ the words of peace and capi-
tulation had been sometimes pronounced ; and several embaffies had
passed between the camp and the city³². The Greek emperor was
humbled by adversity ; and would have yielded to any ternis com-
patible with religion and royalty. The Turkish sultan was defirous
of sparing the blood of his soldier83 still more defu-ons of securing
for his own use the Byzantine treasure83 and he accomplilhed a
sacred duty in presenting to the Gabours, the choice of circumcis10n‚
of tribute, or of death. The avarice of Mahomet might have been
satisfied with an annual sum of one hundred thousand ducats: but
his ambition grasped the capital of the East : to the prince he offered
a rich equivalent, to the people a free toleration,' or a safe depar-
ture: but after some fruitless treaty, he declared his resolution of
finding either a- throne, or a grave, under the walls of Constanti-
nople. A sense of honour, and the fear of universal reproach, sor-
bade Palaeologus to refign the city into the hands of the Ottomans ;
and he determined to abide the last extremities of war. Several
days were employed by the sultan in the preparations of the affimlt ;
and a respite was granted by his favourite science of astrology, which
had fixed on the twenty-ninth of May, as the fortunate and fatal
hour. On the evening of the twenty—seventh, he iffned his final
