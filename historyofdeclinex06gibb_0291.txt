in raifing the walls, and narrowing the cells, had been ingenioully
contrived to prevent their escape, and aggravate their miser-y 5 and
the work was incessantly pressed by the daily visits of the tyram.
His guards watched at the gare, and as he stood in the inner-court
to overlook the architects, without fear or suspicion, he was affaulted
and laid breathless on the ground, by two resolute prisoners of the
Palaeologian race³⁰, who were armed with sticks, and animated by
despair. On the rumour of revenge and liberty, the captive multi-
tude broke their fetters, fortified their prison, and exposed from the
battlements the tyrant's head, presuming on the favour of the people
and the clemency of the empress. Anne of Savoy might rejoice in
the fall of an haughty and ambitious minister, but while {he de·-
layed to resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the mariners,
were excited by the widow of the great duke to a sedition, an
affault, and a maffacre. The prisoners (of whom the far greater
part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a neigh-
bouring church: they were ssaughtered at the foot of the altar3
and in his death the monster was not less bloody and venomous
than in his life. Yet his talents alone upheld the cause of the young
emperor; and his surviving affociates‚ suspicions of each other,
abandoned the conduct of the war, and reje8oed the fairest terms
of accommodation. In the beginning of the dispute, the empress
felt and complained‚ that she was deceived by the enemies of
Cantacuzene : the patriarch was employed to preach against the for-
giveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal hatred was scaled
by an oath, under the penalty of excommunicati0n³¹. But Anne

who might referit, with royal indignation, spares the empress, the mother of his so-

Apocaucus may deservea peculiar reference Gregoras expresses a particular animofity
to Cantacuzene (Liii. c. 86.) and Nic-Gre- (l. xiv. ιο, 11. xv. 5.). It is true, that
