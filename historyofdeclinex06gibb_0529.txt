OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The remaining fragments of the Greek kingdom in Europe and
Asia Ishall abandon to the Turkish arms; but the final extineuon
of the two last dynasties⁸⁵
should terminate the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the
East. The despots of the Morea, Demetrius and Thomas ⁸⁶, the
two surviving brothers of the name of PALAEOLOGUS, were asto-
nissred by the death of the emperor Constantine, and the ruin of the

monarchy. Hopeless of defence, they prepared with the noble
Greeks who adhered to their fortune, to seek a refuge in Italy, be-
yond the reach of the Ottoman thunder. Their first apprehenfions
were dispelled by the viiiorious sultam, who contented himself with

which have reigned in Constantinople,

a tribute of twelve thousand ducats3 and while his ambition ex-
plored the continent and the issands in search of prey, he indulged
the Morea in a respite of seven years. But this respite was a period
of grief, discord, and misery. The hexamilim, the rampart Of the
Isthmus, so often raised and. so often subverted, could not long be
defended by three hundred Italian archei-s: the keys of Corinth

were seized by the Turks ε they returned from their summer excur-
fions with a train of captives and spoil ; and the complaints of the
injured Greeks were heard with indifference and disdain. The Al-
banians, a vagrant tribe of ihepherds and robbers, filled the penin-
sula with rapine and murder ι the two despots implored the danger-
ous and humiliating aid of a neighbouring bashavv3 and when he
had quelled the revolt, his leffons inculcated the rule of their future

force than by composition. But, 1. Idoubt Byzant. p. i95.) 3v for the last Palaeologi‚ the
