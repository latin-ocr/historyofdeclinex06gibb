THE DECLINE AND FALL

till at length the hopeless monarch, protesting his innocence and
accufing his fortune, ascended a funeral pile, and gave orders, that,
as soon as he had stabbed himself, the fire should be kindled by his
attendants. The dynasty of the Song, the native and ancient sove-
reigns of the whole empire‚ survived about forty-five years the fall
of the northern usurpers; and the perse& conquest was reserved for
the arms of Cublai. During this interval, the Moguls were often
diverted by foreign wars3 and, if the Chiuese seldom dared to meet
their vicsstors in the field, their paffive courage presented an endless
succeffion of cities to storm and of millions to ssaughter. In the
attack and defence of places, the engines of antiquity and the Greek
fire were alternately employed : the use os gunpowder in carmon and
bombs appears as a familiar praitice²³3 and the fieges were con-

duffoed by the Mahometans and Franks, who had been liberally in-
vited into the service of Cublai. After pafling the great river, the
troops and artillery were conveyed along a series of canals, till they
invested the royal refidence of Hamcheu‚ or ,Qinsay, in the country
of filk, the most delicious climate of China. The emperor, a de-
fenceless youth, surrendered his person and sceptre; and before he
was sent in exile into Tartary he struck nine times the ground with
his forehead, to adore in prayer or thanksgiving the mercy of the
Yet the war (it was now styled a rebellion) was still
maintained in the southern provinces from Hamcheu to Canton3
and the obstinate remnant of independence and hostility was trans-
ported from the land to the sea. But when the fleet of the Song was-
surrounded and oppreffed by a superior armament, their last cham-

²³ Ι depend on the knowledge and fidelity
of the Pete Gaubih who translates the Chinese
text of the Annals of the Moguls or Yuen
(p. 7¹· 93. ¹53.); butI am ignorant at what
time these annals were composed and publish-
ed. The two uncles of Marco Polo, who
served as engineers at the siege cf Siengyang-
fou (1, ii. c. 61. in Ramnfio, tom. ii. See
Gaubil, p. 155. 157.), must have felt and re-
laced the effects of this destructive pomer, and

their silence is a weighty‚ and almost decifive,
objeftion. 1 entertain a suspicion, that the re·
centdiscovery was carried from Europe to China
by the caravans ofthe xx‘h century, and falsely,
adopted as an old national discovery before
the arrival of the Portuguese and Jesuits in<
the xvith. Yet the Pere Gaubil affirms, that

the use os gunpowder has been known to the-
Chinese above 1600 years.
