Yet in the cloyster, the mind of Cantacnzene was still exercised by

light (if theological war. He sharpened a controversial pen against the Jews
{noim Tha- and Mahometans ³³ ; and in every state, he defended with equal zeal
&sik-13³9 the divine light of mount Thabor, a memorable question which con-

summates the religious follies of the Greeks. The fakirs of India³⁹‚
and the monks of the Oriental chureh, were alike persuaded, that,
in total abstractim] of the faculties of the mind and body, the purer
spirit may ascend to the enjoyment and vision of the Deity. The
opinion and practice of the monasteries of mount Athos ⁴⁰ will be
best represented in the words of an abbot, who flourilhed in the
eleventh century. “ When thou art alone in thy cell,” says the
ascetic macher, “ shut thy door, and seat thyself in a corner3 raise
“ thy mind above all things vain and tranfit0ry3 recline thy beard
“ and chin on thy breast; turn thy eyes and thy thought towards
“the middle of thy belly, the region of the nave13 and search the
“ place of the heart, the seat of the soul. At first, all will be dark
“ and comfortless; but if you persevere day and night, you will
“ feel an ineffable joy; and no sooner has the soul discovered the
“ place of the beart, than it is involved in a mystic and etherial
‘f light.” This light, the produifion of a distempered fancy, the

creature of an empty stomach and an empty brain, was adored by

honoured with a letter from the pope (Fleury,
Hist. Eccles. tom. xx. p. ²50·)· His death
is placed by respectable authority on the 20¹¹¹
of November 1411 (Ducange, Fam. Byzant.
p. 260.). But if he were of the age of his
companion Andronicus the Younger, he must
have lived 116 years; a rare instance of lon-
gevity, which in so illustrious a person would
have attracted universal notice.

³¹³ His four discourses, or books, were
printed at Bafil ¹543 (Fabric. Bibliot. Gra-c.
torn. vi. p. 473.). He composed them to
satissy a proselyte who was affaulted with

letters from his friends of Ispahan. Canta-
cuzene had read the Koran; but 1 under·-
stand from Mameci, that he adopts the vul-
gar prejudices and fables against Mahomet
and his religion.
