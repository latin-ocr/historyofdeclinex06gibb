Praxiteles, the Latins might turn alide with stupid contempt ⁹⁹3 but

unless they were cmlhed by some accidental injury, those useless

stones stood secure on their pedestals¹⁰⁰. The most enlightened of

the strangers, above the gross and sensual pursuits of their country-

men, more pioussy exercised the right of conquest in the search and

seizure of the relies of the saints ¹⁰¹. Immense was the supply οξ

antiquity, many that still existed in the twelfth century are now
lost. But the pilgrims were not solicitous to save or transport the
volumes of an unknown tongue: the perishable substance of paper or
parchment can only he preserved by the multiplicity of copies; the
literature of the Greeks had almost centered in the metropolis; and,

crative plunder was imported from the East ¹⁰².

without computing the extent of our loss, we may drop a tear over the
libraries that have perished in the triple fire of Constantinople¹⁰³.

⁹⁹ In two passages of Nicetas (edit. Paris,

p. 360. Fabric. p. 408.), the Latins are
branded with the lively reproach of δι τε κ ’λε

anfonsus Ezfssnfor, and their avarice of brass
is clearly expreffed. Yet the Venetians had

and this order, which he received in his

elegant Latin work, de'Bello Constantinopo-
