To the spirit and constitution of that nation, a strong and singular
influence may however be ascribed. The primitive subjeets of
Othman were the four hundred families of wandering kamans,
who had followed his ancestors from the Oxus to the Sangar ς and
the plains of Anatolia are still covered with the white and black
tents of their rustic brethren. But this original drop was diffolved

most honourable inhabitants; but they have abandoned, at least in
Romania, the villages, and the cultivation of the land, to the Christian
peasants. In the vigorous age of the Ottoman government, the
Turks were themselves excluded from all civil and military honours ς
and a servile class, an artificial people, was raised by the discipline*
of education to obey, to conquer, and to command ⁸⁷. From the

Europe. The provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria,
and Servia‚ became the perpetual seminary of the Turkish army3
and when the royal fifth of the captives was diminissied by con-

or fourteen years, the most robust youths were torn from their
parents; their names were enrolled in a b00k3 and from that mo-
