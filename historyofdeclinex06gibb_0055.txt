and counts; but a French baron (he is supposed to be Robert of 1⁰s⁰¹e¹¹0³0f

Paris ⁷¹) presumed to ascend? the throne, and to place himself by
the fide of Alexius. The fage reproof of Baldvvin provoked him
to exclaim, in his barbarous idiom, ‘⁶ Who is this rustic, that keeps
“ his seat, while so many valiant captains are standing round
“ him ?'' The emperor maintained his filence, diffembled his in-
dignation, and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of
the words, which he partly suspedted from the universal language of
gesture and countenance. Before the departure of the pilgrims, he
endeavoured to learn the name and condition of the audacious
baron. “ Ι am a Frenchman‚’' replied Robert‚ “ of the purest and
“ most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that
“ there is a church in my neighbourhood ⁷², the resort of those who

“ an antagonist who dared to accept my defiance.”

⁷0 The proud histor-iaus of the crusades
sside and stumble over this humiliating step.
Yet, since the heroes knelt to salute the em-
peror as he sat motionless on his throne, it is
clear that they must have kiffed either his feet
or knees. lt is only fingular, that Anna
should not have amply supplied the silence or
ambiguity of the Latius. The abasement
'of their princes, would have added a fine
chapter to the Ceremoniale Aulae Byzantinae.

⁷¹ He called himself Φραγγος 'exemp-og των
ιυφενων (Alexias, l. x. p. 301.). What a title
of nobleffi of the xi¹¹¹ century, is any one
could now prove his inherirance! Anna re-
lates‚ with vifible pleasure, that the swelling
Balbarlam Λατονος τετυφωμευος, was killed, or

wounded, after fighting in the front in the
battle of Dorylaeum (1. xi. p. 3¹7·)· This
circumstance may justify the suspicion ofDu-
cange (Not. p. 362 ), that he was no other
than Robert of Paris, of the distri& most pe-
culiarly styled the Duchy or Issand of France
(HI-'lle de France).

⁷²· With the same penetration, Ducange dis-
covers his church to be that of St. Drausus,
or Drofin‚ of Soissons, quem duello dimica>-
turi solent invocare: pugiles qui ad memo-
riam ejus (hir romb) pernonant inviEtos red-
