146 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C liiii P. by the honour of restoring an exiled monarch3 or by the sincere

ι-Ν and probable opinion, that theIr efforts in Palestine would be fruit-
less and unavailing, and that the acquisition of Constantinople must
precede and prepare the recovery of Jerusalem. But they were the
chiefs or equals of a valiant band of freemen and volunteers‚ who

and piety, withdrew from the camp; and their retreat was less per-
nicious than the open or secret oppofition of a discontented party,
