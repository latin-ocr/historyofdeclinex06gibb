Dominicans, were dispatched to Venice, to redeem and receive the
holy crown, which had escaped the dangers of the sea and the gallies
of Vataces. On opening a wooden box, they recognised the seals
, of the doge and barons, which were applied on a shrine of silver:
and within this shrine, the monument of the Paffion was inclosed in
a golden vase. The reluctant Venetians yielded to justice and power:
the emperor Frederic granted a free and honourable pass'age ; the
court of France advaneed as far as Troyes in Champagne, to meet
with devotion this inestimable relic: it was borne in triumph through
Paris by the king himself, barefoot‚ and in his shirt ; and a free
gift of ten thousand marks of filver reconciled Baldwin to his loss.
The success of this transaction tempted the Latin emperor to offer
with the same generofity the remaining furniture of his chapel⁵²;
a large and authentic portion of the true cross; the baby·linen of
the Son of G0d3 the lance, the spunge, and the chain, of his Pas-
fion ; the rod of Moses, and part of the sszull of St. John the baptist.
For the reception of these spiritual treasures‚ twenty thousand marks
were expended by St. Louis on a stately foundation, the holy chapeI
of Paris, on which the muse of Boileau has bestowed a comic im-
mortality. The truth of such remote and ancient relies, which
cannot be proved by any human testimony, must be admitted by
those who believe in the miracles which they have performed.
About the middle of the last age, an inveterate ulcer was touched
and cured by an holy prickle of the holy crown ⁵ ³: the prodigy is
attested by the most pious and enlightened Christians of France ; nor
