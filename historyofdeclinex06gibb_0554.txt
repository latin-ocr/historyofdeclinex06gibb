THE DECLINE AND FALL

Capitoline hill, one of her seven eminences ³⁶, is about four hundred
yards in length, and two hundred in breadth. A flight of an hun-
dred steps led to the summit of the Tarpeian rock3 and far steeper
was the ascent before the declivities had been smoothed and the pre-
cipiccs filled by the ruins of fallen edifices. From the earliest agee,
the Capitol had been used as a temple in peace, a fortress in war:
after the loss of the city, it maintained a siege against the victorious
Gauls3 and the sanctuary of empire was occupied, affaulted, and
burnt, in the civil wars of Vitellius and Vespasian ³⁷. The temples
of Jupiter and his kindred deities had crumbled into dust; their
place was supplied by monasteries and houses; and the solid walls,

the long and {helving porficoes, were decayed or ruined by the lapse
of time. It was the first a& of the Romans, an a& of freedom, to

restore the strength, though not the beauty, of the Capitol; to for-
tify the seat of their arms and counsels: and as often as they ascend-
ed the hill, the coldest minds must have glowed with the remem-
ΙΙ. The first Caesars had been invested

with the exclusive coinage of the gold and filver; to the senate they
abandoned the bafer metal of bronze or copper ³

legends were inscribed on a more ample field by the genius of flat-

tery·, and the prince was relieved from the care of celebrating his
own virtues. The succeffors of Diocletian despised even the flattery
of the senate: their royal officers' at Rome, and in the provinces,
assumed the sole direction of the mint3 and the same prerogative
was inherited by the Gothic kings of Italy, and the long series of
the Greek, the French, and the German dynaflies. After an abdi-

³⁶ After many disputes among the anti-
quaries of Rome, it seems determined‚ that
the summit of the Capitoline hill next the
river is strictly the Mons Tarpeius, the Arx;
and that on the other summit, the church
and convent of Araceli, the barefoot sriars
,of St. Francis, occupy the temple of Jupiter

³⁸ This partition of the noble and bafer
metals between the emperor and senate, must
however be adopted, notas a positive fact, but -
as the probable opinion of the best antiquaries

proved and [carce edition of the Baron de la
