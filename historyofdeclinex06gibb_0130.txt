ωε THE DECLINE AND FALL

ς ...ΜΞ ι Gregory the ninth3 for presumimg, the next year, to accomplish
his vow, he was again excommunicated by the same pope ⁸⁹. While
he served under the banner of the cross‚ a crusade was preached

obtained from the sultan the restitution of Jerusalem, of Bethlem
and Nazareth, of Tyre and Sidon: the Latins were allowed to in-
habit and fortify the city3 an equal code of civil and religious free-
dom was ratified for the seCmries of Jesus and those of Mahomet3
