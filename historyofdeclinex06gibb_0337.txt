and repeopled by the policy of Soliman. The abdication of Canta· C H Α Ρ-

cuzene diffolved the feeble bands of domestic alliance3 and his last
advice admonished his countryrnen to decline a rasti contest, and [Ο
compare their own weakness with the numbers and valour, the dis-
cipline and entlmfiasm, of the Nlossems. His prudent counsels were
despised by the headstrong vanity of youth, and soon justified by
the victor-ies of the Ottomans. But as he praffised in the field the
exereise of the jeria', Soliman was killed by a fall from his h0rse5
and the aged Orchan wept and expired on the tornb of his valiant

But the Greeks had not time to rejoice in the death of their

Greeks been surrounded, both in Afra and Europe, by the arms of
the same hostile monarehy. Yet the prudence or generoslty of Amu-

satisfied with the frequent and humble attendance of the emperor

John Palaeologus and his four sons, who followed at his summons ’

the court and camp of the Ottornan prince. He marched against
the Sclavonian nations between the Danube and the Adriatic, the
Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians‚ and Albanian83 and these warlike
