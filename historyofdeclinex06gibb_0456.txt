THE ‘DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

principle of nature and religion. Before his departure for Italy, the
emperor had flatt'ered the city with the assurance of a prompt relies>
and a powerful saccom-3 and the clergy, confident in their ortho-
doxy and science, had promised themselves and their flocks an easy
vidiory over the blind ssiepherds of the W est. The double disapm

prelates was awakened3 the hour of temptation was past ; and they
had more to dread from the public resentrnent, than they could hope*

“ become Azymites.” (The Azymites were those who celebrated
the communion with unleavened bread ; and Ι must retract or qualify·
the praise which I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the

The best proof of their repentance was 'an encrease of zeal for the
most trivial rites and the most incomprehensible doc'trine33 and anv
absolute separation from all, without excepting their prince, who
preserved some regard for honour and consistency. After the de-
cease of the patriarch Joseph‚ the archbishops of Heraclea and Tre«,
bizond had courage to refuse the vacant office3 and cardinal Befl'a-
rion preferred the warm and comfortable shelter of the Vatican-
