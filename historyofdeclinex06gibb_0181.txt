surprise aggrav ated the shame of his defeat, his buckler was found
on the field of battle 3 and the Imperial standard ⁷⁹, a divine image
of the Virgin, was presented, as a trophy and a relic, to the
Cistereian monks, the disciples of St. Bernard. Near three months,
without excepting the holy season of Lem, were consumed in'skir-
missies and preparati0ns‚ before the Latins were ready or resolved
for a general affault. The land-fortifications had been found im-

of the Propontis, the anchorage was unsafe, and the shIps must be
driven by the current far away-to the streights of the Hellespont;

opportunity of breaking the army. From the harbour, therefore,
the afl‘ault was determined by the ass'ailants, and expeeoed by the
befieged3 and the emperor had placed his scarlet pavillions on a.
neighbouring height, to dire& and animate the efforts of his troops.

and gallies, the other on the walls and towers raised above the
ordinary level by several stages of wooden turrets. Their first fury
was spent in the discharge of darts‚ stones, and fire, frOm the
engines3 but the water was dcep; the Freneh were bold3 the Ve-
netians were ss<ilful3 they approached the walls; and a desperate
confli& of swmds, spearS, and battle-axes, was fought on the trem-,
bling bridges that grappled the floating, to the stable‚ batteries. In
more than an hundred places, the assault was urged, and the de-
fenoe was sustained3 till the superiority of ground and numbers
finally prevailed‚ and the Latin trumpets founded a retreat. On
