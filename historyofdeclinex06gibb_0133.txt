OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

In complete armour, the orissannne waving before him, Louis
ieaped foi-ernost on the beach5 and the strong city of Damictta,
which had eost his predecessors a siege of sixteen months, was aban-
doned on the first afl'ault by the trembling Mossems. But Damictta

was the first and the last of his conquests3 and in the fifth and fixth
crusades, the same causes, almost on the same ground, were pro-

fire was incessantly poured on the invaders; the Nile was corn-
manded by the Egyptian gallies‚ the open country by the Arab53
all provisions were intercepted3 each day aggravated the fickness
and famine3 and about the same time a retreat was found to be ne—
