pronounced that no promise can bind the faithful against the interest

and duty of their religion3 and that the sultan may abrogate his
own treaties and those of his predeceffors. The justice ¹and magna-
nimity of Amurath had scorned this immoral privilege ; but his son,
though the proudest of men, could stoop from ambition to the
basest arts of diflimulation and deceit. Peace was on his lips, while
war was in his beart: he inceffantly fighed for the poffeffion of Con-
stantinople; and the Greeks, by their own indiscretion, afforded the
first pretence of the fatal rupture¹'. Instead of labouring to be for-
gotten, their ambaffadors pursued his camp, to demand the payment,
and even the encrease, of their annual stipend: the divan was im-
portuned by their complaints, and the vizir, a secret friend of the
Christiane, was constrained to deliver the sense of his brethren. “ Ye
“ f001iss1 and miserabie Romans? said Cani, '“ we know your de-
“ vices, and ye are ignorant of your own danger! the scrupulous

Ducas (c. 33.), Phranza (l. i. c. 33. l. iii.
c. z.), Chalcocondyles (l. vii. p. 199.)‚ and
Cantemir (p. 96.).

¹¹ Before Ι enter on the fiege of Constanti-

nople I shall observe, that except the short

hints of Cantemir and Leunclavius, I have
not been able to obtain any Turkisti account
of this conquest: such an account as we pos-
sess of the fiege of Rhodes by Soliman II.
(Memoires de l’Academie des Inscriptions,
tom. xxvi. p. 723—769.). Ι must there·
fore depend on the Greeks, whose pre-
judices, in some degree, are subdued by their
distress. Our standard texts are those of
Dueas (c. 34—42.), Phranza (l. iii. c. 7—
20.)‚ Chalcocondyles (1. viii. p. zoi—214.),

aad Leonardus Chienfis (Historia C. P. a

Turco expugnatae. Norimberghae, 1544, in
4‘0, 20 leaves). The last of these narratives
is the earliest in date, fince it was composed
in the isse ofChios, the 16⁸¹ of August 1453,
only seventy-nine days after the loss of the
city, and in the first confufion of ideas and
paffions. Some hints may be added from an
epistle of cardinal Ifidote (in FarraginefRe·
rum Tureigarum, ad calcem Chalcocondyl.
Clauseri, Bam, ¹556) to pope Nicholas V.
and a traCt of Theodofius Zygomala‚ which
he addreffed in the year 1581 to Martin Cru-
fius (Tmen-Graecia, l. i„ p. 74—98. Bam,
1584). The various faets and materiale.
are briefly, though critically, reviewed by
Spondanus (A. D. 1453, ΝΟ 1—27.). The
hearsay relations of Monssrelet and the dis·
tant Latins, I shall take leave to disregard.
