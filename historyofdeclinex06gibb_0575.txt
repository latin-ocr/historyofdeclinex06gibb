Italy deplored their absence3 and Rome, in solitude and poverty,
might repent of the ungovernable freedom which had driven from
the Vatican the succeffor of St. Peter. Her repentance was tardy
and fruitless: after the death of the old memberS, the sacred college

was filled with Freneh cardinals ⁸⁴, who beheld Rome and· Italy with
abhorrence and contempt, and perpetuated a series of national, and
even provincial, popes, attached by the most indissoluble ties to their
native country.
The progress of iudustry had produced and enriched the Italian Institution of

republics: the aera of their liberty is the most flourissiing period of ὲῗειῖἒιῗῐζξὲπ,

that the tribute of subjeffits must for ever nourilh the metropolis of the

by the resort of pilgrims to the ssirines of the apost-les; and the last
legacy of the popes‚ the institution of the HOLY YEAR ²³³, was not
less beneficial to the people than to the clergy. Since the loss of

⁸⁵ Our primitive account is from cardinal
James Caietan (Maxima Bibliot. Parrum,
tom. xxv.) ς and I am at a loss to determine
whether the nephew of Boniface VllI. be a

character.
