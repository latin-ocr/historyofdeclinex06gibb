sons of consuls, may sometimes be discovered³¹. They were be=
stowed by the emperors, or assumed by the most powerful citizens,
to denote their rank, their honours ³², and perhaps the claim of a
pure and patriciam descent: but they float on the surface, without
a series or a substance, the titles of men, not the orders of govern-

ment³³5 and it is only from the year of Christ one thousand one

as a glorious aera, in the acts of the city. A new constitution was

Sigonius (de Regno Italiae, l. vi. opp. tom.ii.
p. 400.) 1 read of the consuls and tribunes
of the ³1¹² century. Both blondus, and even
Sigonius, too freely copied the clsllic method
of supplying from reason or fancy the defi-
cieocy of records.

³¹ In the panegyricos Berengarius (Mu-
ratori, script. Rer. Ital. tom-ii. 1·.i. p.408.),
a Roman is mentioned as consulis natus in
the beginning of the >im century. Muratori
(dissert. v.) discovers in the years 952 and
936, Gratianus in Dei nornine consul et dux,
Georgius consul et dux; and in 1013, Ro-
manus, brother of Gregory VIII. proudly‚
but vaguely, ssyles himself consul et dux et
omnium Romanorum senator.

emperors conferret} on the dukes of Venice,
Naples, Amalphi, διε. the title of ὁπατοε, or
consuls (l’eeChronSagornini, paffim); and the
successore of Charlemagne would not abdicate
any of their prerogative. But in general,
the names of consul and finator, which may
be found among the French and Germans,
fignify no more than count :ind Jord (Signeur,
Ducange, (Bessan). The monkish writers
are often ambitious offine claffic words.

³³ The most constitutioml form, is a di-
ploma of Otho HI. (A.D. 998), Consuli-
bus l'enatfis populique Romani; but the ast is
probably spurious. At the coronation of
HenryI. A. D. 1014, the histarian thhmar
(apud Muratori‚ differt. xxiii.) describes him,

panegyric of Berengarius (p. 406.). bl· d
