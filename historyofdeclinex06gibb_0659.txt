discovery, that, except his friend Ricnzi and one of the Colonna, 2--v—-J
a strangcr of the Rhene was more conversant with these antiquities
than the nobles and natives of the metropolis ⁶⁷. The ignorance and
credulity of the Romans are elaborately displayed in the old survey
of the city which was composed about the beginning of the thir·-
teenth century; and, without dwelling on the manifold errors of
name and place, the legend of the Capitol ⁶⁸ may provoke a smile of
contempt and indignation. “ The Capitol‚’' says the anonymous
writer, “is so named as being the head of the world3 where the
“ consuls and senators formerly refided for the government of the
“ city and the globe. The strong and lofty walls were covered with
“ glass and gold, and crowned with a roof of the richest and most
“ curious carving. Below the citadel stood a palace, of gold for the
“ greatest part, decorated With precious stones, and whose value
“ might be esteemed at one third of the world itself. The sta-

ledge of John Qolonna. Qi enim hodie

Roma cognoscitur quam Romae.

⁶³ After the description of the Capitol, he
adds, statuae erant quot sunt mundi provinciae;
et habebat quaelibet tintinnabulum ad collurn.
Et erant ita per magicam artem dispositae, ut

mentions an example of the Saxons and Sue-
vi, who, after they had been subdued by
Agrippa, again rebelled: tintinnabulum so-
nuit; sacerdos quierat in speculo in hebdo-

back and reduced the—perflans (Anonym-
in Montfaucon, p. 297, 298.).

captus a Romanis invisibiliter exiit, ivitque
Neapolim. A Roman magician, in the xith
century, is introduced by William of Malms-
bury (de Gestis Regum Anglorum, l. ii.
p. 86.) ; and in the time of Flaminius vacca

the strangers (the Garhs) invoked the daemons
