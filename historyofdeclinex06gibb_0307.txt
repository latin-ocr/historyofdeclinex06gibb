OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

⁴ From the spacious highlands between China, Siberia, and the
Caspian Sea, the tide of emigration and war has repeatedly been
poured. These ancient seats of the Huns and Turks vvere occupied
in the twelfth century by many pastoral tribes, of the same deseent
and fimilar manners, which vvere united and led to conquest by the
formidable Zingis. In his ascent to greatness‚ that Barbarian (whose
private appellation was Temugin) had trampled on the necks of his
equals. His birth was noble: but it was in the pride of victory,
that the prince or people deduced his seventh aneestor from the im-

maculate conception of a virgin. His father had reigned over thir-
teen hords‚ which composed about thirty or forty thousand families:
above two-thirds refused to pay tithes or obedience to his infant
son3 and at the age of thirteen, Temugin fought a battle against his
rebellious subjedts. The future conqueror of Afia was reduced to
fly and to obey: but he rose superior to his fortune, and in his
fortieth year he had established his fame and dominion over the
circumjacent tribes. In a state of society, in which policy is rude
and valour is universal, the ascendant of one man must be founded
on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and reeompense
his friends. His first military league was ratified by the fimple rites

.. of sacrificing an horse and tasting of a running stream: Temugin

pledged himself to divide with his followers the sweets and the bitters
of life; and, when he had shared among them his horses and ap-
parel, he was rich in their gratitude and his own hopes. After his
first victory, he placed seventy chaldrons on the fire, and seventy of
the most‚guilty rebels were cast headlong into the boiling water.
The sphere of his attraction was continuaily enlarged by the ruin of
the proud and the submiffion of the prudent; and the boldest
chieftains might tremble, when they beheld, enchased in filver, the
(kun of the khan of the Keraites²3 who, under the name of Prester
