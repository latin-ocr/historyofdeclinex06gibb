OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 621

Jewish triumph. 3. Of the number, which he rassily defines, of C Η Α Ρ·
seven thermae or public baths„ none were sufficiently entire to 're- :iifl—a
present the use and distribution of the several parts; but those of
Diocletian and Antoninus Caracalla still retained the tides Of the
founders, and astoniihed the curious spectator, who, in observing
their solidity and extent, the variety of rnarbleS, the fize and multi-
tude of the columns, compared the labour and expence with the use
and importance. Of the baths of Constantine, of Alexander, of Do-
mitian, or rather-‘of Titus, some vestige might yet be found. 4. The
triumphal arches of Titusg Severus, and Constantine, were entire, both
the struature and the inscriptions ; a falling fragment was honoured
with the name os Trajan 3 and 'two arches, then extant, in the Fla-
minian way, have been ascribed to the bafer memory of Faustina
and Gallienus. 5. After the wonder of the Coliseum, Poggius
might have overlooked a small amphitheatre of brick, most pro-
bably for the use of the praetorian camp: the theatres of Marcellus
and Pompey were occupied in a great 'measure by public and private
buildings; and in the Circus, Agonalis and Maximus, little more
than the situation and the form could be investigated. 6. The
columns of Trajan and Antonine were still ere& ; but the Egyptian
obelisks were broken or buried. A people of gods and heroes, the
workrnanship of art, was reduced to one equestrian figure of gilt
brass, and to five marble statues, of which the most conspicuous
were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. 7. The two mau- „
soleums or sepulchres of Augustus and Hadrian could not totally be
lost; but the former was only vifible as a mound of earth ; and the
latter, the castle of St. Angelo, had acquired the name and appear-
ance of a moderntfortress. With the addition of some separate and
nameless columns, such were the remains of the ancient city: for
the marks of a more recent stru&ure might be detected in the
walls, which formed a circumferenee of ten miles, included
three hundred and seventy-nine turretS, and opened into the country

by thirteen gates. 8 ¹
