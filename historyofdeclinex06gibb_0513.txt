OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

“ fairest and most wealthy3 and my gratitude shall accumulate his
“ honours and fortunes above the measure of his own hopes.” Such
various and potent motives diffused among the Turks a general
ardour, regardless of life and impatient for aetion: the camp re-
echoed with the Mossem shouts of, ‘⁶ God is God, there is but one
“ God, and Mahomet is the apostle of G0d⁵⁴;” and the sea and

land, from Galata to the seven towers‚ were illuminated by the blaze
of their nocturnal fires.

Far different was the state of the Christians3 who, with loud and
impotent complaints, deplored the guilt, or the punishment, of their
fins. The celestial image of the Virgin had been exposed in solemn
proceffion3 but their divine patroness was deaf to their entreaties;
they accused the obstinacy of the emperor for refusmg a timely sur-
render; anticipated the horrors of their fate; and fighed for the
repose and security of Turkish servitude. The noblest of the
Greeks, and the bravest of the allies, were summoned to the palace,
to prepare them, on the evening of the twenty-eighth, for the
duties and dangers of the general affault. The last speech of Pa-
laeologus was the funeral oration of the Roman empire⁵⁵: he pro-
mised, he conjured, and he vainly attempted to infuse the hope
which was extinguissred in his own mind. In this world all was
comfortless and gloomy3 and neither the gospel nor the church have
proposed any conspicuous recompense to the heroes who fall in the
service of their country. But the example of their prime, and the
confinement of a fiege, had armed these warriors with the courage
of despair; and the pathetie scene is described by the feelings of
the historian Phranza, who was himself present at this mournful
affembly. They wept, they embraced ; regardless of their families
