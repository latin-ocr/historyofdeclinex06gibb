116 THE DECLINE AND FALL

that of his soldiers‚ was obtained by the restitution of Darnietta⁹⁸
and the payment of four hundred thousand pieces of gold. In a
soft ancl luxurious climate, the degener-ate children of the companions
of Noureddin and Saladin were incapable of refisting the flower of
European chivalry: they triurnphed by the arms of their ssaves or
Mamalukes, the hardy natives of Tartary, who at a tender age had'
been purchased of the Syrian merchantS, and were educated in the
camp and palace of the sultam. But Egypt soon afforded a new ex-
ample of the danger of praetorian band83 and the rage of these fe-
rocious animast„ who had been let loose on the strangers, was pro-
voked to devour their benefactor. In the pride of conquest, Touran·
Shaw, the last of his race, was murdered by his Mamalukes; and the
most daring of the affaffins entered the chamber of the captive king,
with drawn scymetars‚ and their hands imbrued in the blood of their

sultan. The firmness of Louis commanded their respect⁹⁹3 their

avarice prevailed over cruelty and zea] ; the treaty was accompliffied 3
and the king of France, with the relies of his army, was permitted
to embark for Palestine. He wasted four years within the walls of
Aere, unable to vifit Jerusalem, and unwilling to return without
glory to his native country.

The memory of his defeat excited Louis‚ after fixteen years of

wisdorn and repose, to undertake the seventh and last ofthe crusades.

⁹⁸ For the ransom of St. Louis, a million
of byzants was asked and granted3 but
the sultan’s generefity reduced that sum to
800,000 byzants, Which are valued by Join-
ville at 400‚000 French livres of his own
time, and express‘ed by Matthew Paris by
100‚000 marks of filver (Ducange, Disserta-
tion xx. sur Joinville).

⁹9 The idea of the emirs to ehuse Louis
for their sultam is serioussy attested by Join-
ville (p.77, 78.), and does not appear to me
so absurd as to M. de Voltaire (Hist. Gene-
rale, tom. ii. p. 386, 387.). The Mama-
lukes themselves were strangerS, rebele,
and equals; they had felt his valonr, they
hoped his converfion; and such a motion,
which was not seconded, might be made,

perhaps by a secret Christian, in their tumult,
