OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

city into the hands of the infidels. The emperor was at once· the C H Α R.

enemy of the two rivals; from whom he had sustained, and to
whom he had offered, an injury3 and the vietory of Amurath was
followed, in the ensuing spring, by the stege of Constantinople ⁸².
The religious merit of subduing the city of the Caesars, attracted
from Asia a crowd of volunteers, who aspired to the crown of mar—
tyrdom ι their military ardour was inflamed by the promise of rich
spoils and beautiful females3 and the sultan's ambition was conse-
'crated by the presence and prediEtion of Seid Beehar, a descendant
of the prophet ⁸³, who arrived in the camp, on a mule, with ave-
nerable train of five hundred disciples. But he might ⁴blush, if a,

fanatic could blush, at the failure of his assurances. The strength of

the walls refisted an army of two hundred thousand Turks: their
” assaults were repelled by the sallies of the Greeks and their foreign

mercenaries3 the old resources of defence were opposed to the new
engines of attack3 and the enthufiasm of the dervish, who was

snatched to heaven in vifionary converse with Mahomet, was

answered by the credulity of the Christians‚ who beheld the Virgin
Mary, in a violet garment, walking on the rampart and animating
their courage ¹³⁴. After a fiege of two months, Amurath was re-
called to Boursa by a domestic revolt, which had been kindled by
Greek treachery, and was soon extinguished by the death of a guilt-
-less brother. While he led his Janizaries to new conquests in Eu-
rope and Asta, the Byzantine empire was indulged in a servile and
precarious respite of thirty years. Manuel sunk into the grave3
and John Palaeologus was pertnitted to reign, for an annual tribute
of three hundred thousand aspers, and the derelidfion of almost all
that he held beyond the suburbe of Constantinople.
