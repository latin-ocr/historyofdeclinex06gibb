and country on a perilous experiment. His father's advice still
dwelt on his memory: and reason must suggest, that smee the Latins
were divided among themselves, they could never unite in a foreign
cause. Sigismond diffuaded the unseasonable adventure3 his advice
was impartial‚ slnce he adhered to the council ; and it was enforced
by the strange belief, that the German Caesar would nominate a
Greek his heir and succeffor in the empire of the W‘est ⁴⁶. Even the
Turkish sultan was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust,
but whom it was dangerous to offend. Amurath was unskilled in
the disputes, buthe was apprehensive of the union, of the Christians,
From his own treasures, he offered to relieve the wants of the By-
zantine court; yet he declared with seeming magnanimity, that Con-
stantinople should be secure and inviolate, in the absence of her so-
vereign ⁴⁷. The resolution of Palaeologus was decided by the most

splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he wished to escape

for a while from a scene of danger and distress; and after dismissing
with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the council, he decl-ared
his intention of embarking in the Roman gallies. The age of the'
patriarch Joseph was more susceptible of fear than of hope; he trem-
bled at the perils of the sea, and expreffed his apprehension, that
his feeble voice, with thirty perhaps of h'is orthodox brethrem would
be oppreffed in a foreign land by the power and numbers of a Latin
synod. He yielded to the royal mandate, to the flattering affurance,
that he would be heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret
