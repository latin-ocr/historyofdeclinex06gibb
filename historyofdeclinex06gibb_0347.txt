OF THE ROMAN EMPIRF..

cousm John of Selybria, who, in eight years of civil war, asserted
his right ofprimogeniturc. At length the ambition of the victorious
sultan pointed to the conquest of Constantinople ; but he listened to
the advice of his vizir, who represented, that such an enterprise
might unite the powers of Christcndom in a second and more formi-
dable crus-ade. His epissle to the emperor was conceived in these
words: “ By the divine clemency, our invincible scymetar has re-
“ duced to our obedience almost all Asta, with many and large coun-
“ tries in Europe, excepting only the city of Constantinople3 for
“ beyond the walls thou hast nothing left. Refign that city; stipulate
“ thy reward3 or tremble‚ for thyself and thy unhappy people‚ at the
“ consequences of a rath refusal.’' But his ambaffadors were instruCted
to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, which was subscribed
with submission and gratitude. A truce of ten years was purchased
by an annual tribute of thirty thousand crowns of gold: the

Greeks deplored the public toleration of the law of Mahomet, and

Bajazet enjoyed the glory of establiffiing a Turkiffi cadhi, and found· »

ing a royal mosch in the metropolis of the Eastern church ⁶⁷. Yet
this truce was soon violated by the restless sultan: in the cause of
the prince of Selybria, the lawful emperor, an army of Ottomans‚
again threatened Constantinople; and the distress of Manuel im-
plored the protetffion of the king of France. His plaintive embaffy
obtained much pity and some relief 3 and the conducit of the succour
was entrusted to the marshal BouciCault ⁶⁸, whose religious chivalry
was inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the infidels.
He sailed with four ships of war, from Aiguesmortes to the Helles-
pont3 forced the passage, which was guarded by seventeen Turkish
gallies3 lauded at Constantinople a supply of fix hundred men at
arms and fixteen hundred archers; and reviewed them in the ad-
