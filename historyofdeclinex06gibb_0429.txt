OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

was their indigence, that their arrears, the payment of a debt, would C H Λ P.

be accepted as a favour, and might operate as a bribe⁶⁷.
and relief of Constantinople might excuse some prudent and pious

⁴ diffimulation ; and it wasv infinuated, that the obstinate heretica who

should refist the consent of the East and west, would be abandoned

in a hostile land to the revenge or justice of the Roman pontiff⁶⁸.
In the first private affernbly of the Greeks, the formulary of union
was approved by twenty-four, and rejected by twelve, members : but
the five craſs-hearers of St. Sophia, who aspired to represent the
patriarch, were disqualified by ancient discipline; and their right os
voting was transferred to an obsequious train of monks, grammarians,
and profane laymen. The will of the monarch produced a false and
servile unanimity, and no more than two patriots had courage to
speak their own sentiments and those of their country. Demetrius,
the emperor's brother, retired to Venice, that he might not be wit—
ness of the union; and Mark of Ephesus, mistaking perhaps his
pride for his conscience, disclaimed all communion with the Latin
heretics, and avowed himself the champion and confeffor of the or-
thodox creed ⁶⁹. In the treaty between the two natione, several forms
of consent were proposed, such as might satisfy the Latius, without
dishonouring the Greeks: and they weighed the scruples of words
and syllables, till the theological balance trembled with a ssight pre-
ponderance in favour of the Vatican. It was agreed (I must intreat
the attention of the reader), that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father and the Son, as from one principle and one substance 3 that

he proceeds by the Son, beIng of the same nature and substance, and

⁶⁷ Syr-opulus denies that the Greeks re-
ceived any money before they had subscribed
the a& of union (p. 283.): yet he relates
some suspiciouscircumstance53 and their bribery
and corruption are positively affirmcd by the
historian Ducas.

⁶²³ The Greeks most piteoussy express their
own fears of exile and ⁴perpetual ssavery

{Sy-repul. p. 196.): and they were strongly

moved by the emperor’s threats (p. z6o.).
⁶9 1 had foi-got another popular and ortho-
dox protester; a favourite hound, who usually
lay quiet on the foot-cloth of the einperor's
throne3 but who barked most surioussy while
the a& of union was reading, without being
filenced by the soothing or the lalhes of the
royal attendants (Syropul. p. 265, 266.).
