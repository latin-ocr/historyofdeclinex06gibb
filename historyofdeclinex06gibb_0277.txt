ssrcpherd was again odious to the flock ; and his enemies contrived ι-Ὗ-ι

a singular, and as it proved a successful, mode of revenge. In the
night, they stole away the footstool or foot-cloth of his throne,
which they secretly replaced with the decoration of a satirical pic—
ture. The emperor was painted with a bridle in his mouth, and
Athanasius leading the tradtable beast to the feet of Christ. The

authors of the libel were detected and punished; but as their lives
had been spared, the Christian priest in sullen indignation retired to
his cell ; and the eyes of Andronicus, which had been opened for a
’moment, were again closed by his successor.

If this transafflon be one of the most curious and important of a
reign of fifty years, Ι cannot at least accuse the brevity of my ma-
terials‚ since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios of
Pachymer³, Cantacuzene ⁴, and Nicephorus Gregoras', who have
composed the prolix and languid story of the times. The name and
situation of the emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most
lively curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the re-
volt of the younger Andronicus to his own abdication of the empire3
and it is observed, that, like Moses and Caesar, he was the principal
aecor in the scenes which he describes. But in this eloquent work,
we should vainly seek the fincerity of an hero or a penitent. Retired
in a cloyster from the vices and paffions os the world, he presents

not a confession, but an apology, of the life of an ambitious states-
man. Instead of unfolding the true counsels and chara&ers of men,
