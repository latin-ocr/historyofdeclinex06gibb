OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

But the faim rudiments of Greek learning, which Pctrarch had
encouragcd and Boccace had planted, soon withered and expired.
The succecding generation was content for a while with the im-
provement of Latin eloquence: nor was it before the end of the
fourteenth century, that a new and perpetual flame was rekindled in
Italy⁹⁶. Previous to his own journey, the emperor Manuel dis-
patched his envoys and orators to implore the compassion of the
Western princes. Of these envoys, the most conspicuous, or the most
learned, was Manuel Chrysoloras⁹⁷, of noble birth, ancl whose Ro-
man ancestors are supposed to have migrated with the great Con-
stantine. After visiting the courts of France and Engkmd, where
he obtained some contributions and more promises, the envoy was
invited to assume the office of a profeffor3 and Florence had again
the honour of this second invitation. By his knowledge, not only
of the Greek, but of the Latin, tongue, Chrysoloras deserved the
stipend, and surpaffed the expectation, of the republic: his school
was frequented by a crowd of disciples of every rank and age3 and
one of these, in a general history, has described his motives and his
success. ‘⁶ At that time‚” says Leonard Aretin⁹⁸, “ I was a student

“ of the civil law3 but my soul was inflamed with the love of
“ letters; and Ibestowed some application on the sciences of lo'gic
“ and rhetoric. On the arrival of Manuel, I hefitated whetherI
“ should desert my legal studies, or relinquish this golden opportu-

⁹⁶ Dr. Hody (p. 54.) is angry with Leonard
Aretin, Guarinus, Paulus Joviu5‚ διε, for
affiming, that the Greek letters were restored
in Italy pcstfiptingentos annom as if, says hc,
they had flourissied till the end of the ,hm
century. These writers most probably rec-
koned from the last period of the exarcliate3
and the presence of the Greek magistrates
and troops at Ravenna and Rome, must have
preserved, in some degree, the use of their
native tongue-

⁹⁷ See the article of Emanuel, or Manuel
Chrysoloras, in Hody (p. 12-54·) and Ti-

raboschi (tom.vii. p. 113-118.). The pre-

eise date of his arrival floats between the years
1390 and 1400, and is only eonfined by the
reign of BonifaceIX.
⁹⁸ The name of Aretinus has been assumed
by five or six natives of Arezzo in Tuscany,
of whom the most famous and the most worth-
less lived in the xvith century. Leonardus
Brunus Aretinus, the disciple of Chrysploms,
was a linguist, an orator, and an histor-ian,
the secretary of four success'ive popeS, and the
chancellor of the republic of FIorence, where
he died A.D. 1444, at the age of seventy-five
(Fabric. Bibliot. medii AEvi, tom. i. p. 190,
&a Tiraboschi, tom.vii. p. 33—38.).
