h-w--s the Adriatic, and from the confines of Naples to the banks of the

Po; and as early as the fixteenth century, the greater part of that
spacious and fruitful country acknowledged the lawful claims and
temporal sovereignty of the Roman pontiffs. Their claims were
readily deduced from the genuine, or fabulous, donations of the
darker ages: the succeffive steps of their final settlement would engage
us too far in the transaoions of Italy, and even of Europe; the
crimes of Alexander the fixth‚ the martial operations of Julius
the second, and the liberal policy of Leo the tenth, a theme which
has been adorned by the pens of the noblest historians of the times ³⁹.
In the first period of their conquests, till the expedition of Charles
the eighth, the popes might successfully wrestle with the adjacent
princes and states, whose military force was equal‚ or inferior, to their
own. But as soon as the monarchs of France, Germany, and Spain,
contended with gigantic arms for the dominion of Italy, they sup-
plied with art the deficiency of strength ; and concealed, in a laby-
rinth of wars and treaties, their aspiring views, and the immortal
hope of chacing the Barbarians beyond the Alps. The nice balance
of the Vatican was often subverted by the soldiers of the North and
West, who were united under the standard of Charles the fifth : the
feeble and fluCtuating policy of Clement the seventh exposed his per-
son and dominions to the conqueror3 and Rome was abandoned
seven months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapacious than the
Goths and Vandals ⁹⁰. After this severe leison, the popes contraCted
their ambition, which was almost satisfied‚ resumed the character
of a common parent, and abstained from all offenfive hostilities,
