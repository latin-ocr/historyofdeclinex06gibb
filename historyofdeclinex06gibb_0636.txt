618 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {ix} Ρ· am 1 wssHng, in these last moments‚ to offend even the pope and

k--v-—a clergy of Rome ⁹⁰.

⁹⁸ The histories of the church, Italy, and
Christendom, have contributed to the chapter
which 1 now conclude. In the original Lives
of the Popes, we often discover the city and
republic os Rome; and the events of the xix-¹¹¹
and xv‘¹¹ centuries are preserved in the rude
and domestic chronicles which Ihave care-
fully inspeciem and shall recapitulare in the
order of time.
1. Monaldeschi (Ludovici Boncomitis) Frag-
menta Annalium Roman. A.D. 1328,

different libraries of Italy and France
(M. de Foncemagne, in the Mernoires
de l‘Acad. des Inscript. tom. xvii. p. 597
—606.).
Except the last, all these fragments and
diaries are inserted in the Collefflons of Mu-
ratori‚ my guide and master in the history ofv
Italy. His country, and the public, are in-
debted to him for the following works on
that subject: 1. Rerum Italicarum Scriptores
(Α. D. 500—1 500), quorumpotiffi'ma pars nune

ΞΠ the scriptores Rerum halim-sum Os primum in lucem prodit, &mxxviii vols.in sollo,

muratori, tom. xii. p. 523- N. B. The
credit of this fragment is somewhat hurt
by a singular interpolation, in which the
author relates his own death at the age
of 1 ις years.

2. Fragmenta Historiae Romanae (vulgo
Thomas Fortifioccae), in Romana Dia-
1εᾶο vulgari (A. D. 1327—1354, in
Muratori, Antiquitat. medii AEvi Italiae,
torn. iii. p. ²47-S48·)² the authentic
ground-work of the history of Rienzi.

3. Delphini (Gentilis) Diarium Romanum
(A. D. 1370—1410)‚ in the Rerum Ita-
licarum, tom. iii. P.ii. p, 846.

4. Antonii (Petri) Diarium Rom. (A. D.
1404—1417 ),, tom. xxiv. p. 969.

5. Petroni (Pauli) Miscellanea. l-fistorica
Romana (A.D. 1433—1446), tom-xxiv.

. 1 101.

&pxlolaterrani (Jacob.) Diarium Rom.
(A.D. 1472—1484)‚tom.xxiii. p. 81.
7. Anonymi Diarium Urbis Romae (A.D.
1481—1492)‚ tom-iii. P.ii. p. 1069.
8. Inseffurae (Stephani) Diarium Romanum
(A. D. 1294, or 1378—1494.), tom.iii.

P. ii. p. 1¹09·

9. Historia Arcana Alexandri VI. five Ex-
cerpta ex Diario Joh. Burcardi (A.D.
1492—1503)‚ edita a Godefr. Gulielm.
Leibnizio, Hanover, 1697, in 4¹⁰. The
large and valuable Journal of Burcard
might be completed stom the MSS. in

Milan, 1723—1738. ¹75¹· A volume of
chronological and alphabetical tables is still
wanting as a key to this great work, which
is yet in a disorderly and defective state.
2. Antiquitates Italiae medii AEvi‚ vi vols. in
solio, Milan, 1738—1743‚ in lxxv curicus
differtations on the manners, government‚
religion, Sec. of the Italians of the darker
ages, with a large supplement of chartea,
chronicles, &c. 3. Dtjffl’rtiom' fhpra le Anti-
quita Italiane, iii vols. in 4²⁰, Milano, 1731,
a free verlion by the author, which may be
quoted with the same confidence as the Latin
text of the Antiquities. 4. Annali d'Italia,
xviii vols. in octavo, Milan, 1753—1756, a
dry, though accurate and useful, abridge—
ment of the history of Italy from the birth of
Christ to the middle of the xviiith century.
ς. Dell' Antichita Estenſs ed Italiam, ii vols.
in folio, Medma, 1717· 1740. In the history
of this illustrious race, the parent of our
Brunswick kings, the critic is not seduced by
the loyalty or gratitude of the subjefih In
all· his works, Muratori approves himself a
diligent and laborious writer, who aspires
above the prejudices of a Catholic priest.
He wae born in· the year 1672, and died in
the year 1750, after paffing near fixty years
in the libraries of Milan and Modena (Vita
del Proposto Ludovico Antonio Muratori, by
his nephew and successor Gian. Francesco
Soli Muraxori, Venezia‚ 1756, in 4²⁰).
