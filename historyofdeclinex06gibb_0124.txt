nions. The hero, ascending an hill, and veiling his face, exclaimed

with an indignant voice, “ Those who are unwilling to rescue‚ are
“ unworthy to view, the sepulchre of Christ !'‘ After his return to
Aere, on the news that Jaffa was surprised by the sultam, he sailed
with some merchant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach ; the*
castle was relieved by his presence; and fixty thousand Turks and
Saracens fled before his arms.> The discovery of his weakness pro-
voked thern to return in the morning3 and they found him care-
lessly encamped before the gates with only seventeen knights and

three hundred archers. &Vithout counting their numbers, he sus- ’

tained their charge; and we learn from the evidence of his enemies,
that the king of England, grasping his lance, rode furioussy along
their front, from the right to the left wing, without meeting an ad-
versary who dared to encounter his career ⁷⁸. Am Ι writing the Ἰ

During these hostilities, a languid and tedious negociation ⁷⁹ be-
tween the Franks and Mossems, was started, and continued, and
broken, and again resumed, and again broken. Some aeis of royal
courtesy, the gift of snow and fruit, the exchange of Norway hawks
and Arabiam horses, softened the asperity of religious war: from the
viciffitude of succesS‚ the monarchs might leam to suspe& that
Heaven was neuter in the qnarrel ; nor, after the trial of each other,

Richard and Saladin appeared to be in a declining state ;, and they

and Jaffa, are related by Bohadin (p. 184-

author of the Itinerary, or the monk ofSt. Al-
ban’s‚ cannot exaggeratethe Cadhi’s account

’ of the prowess of Richard (Vinisaufi l.vi.

c. 14-24, p. 412—421. Hist. Major, p. 137
-143.); and on the whole ofthis war, there
is a marvellous agreement between the Chris-
tian and Mahomctan writers, who mutu-ally
praise the virtues of their enemies. ⁴

hostility in Bohadin (p. 207—260.)‚ who was
himself an anor inibe treaty. Richard de·

clar-ed his intenti0n of returning with new
armies to the conquest of the Holy Land3
and Saladin answered the menace with a civil
compliment (Vinisauf, l. vi. c. 28. p. 4²3·)·

of this holy war, is Galfridi ὲ Vinisauf Iti-
nerarium Regis Anglorurn Richardi et alio-
rum in Terram Hierosolymorum, in six books,
published in the iad volume os Gale’s Scrip-
tores Hist.Anglicanae (p. 247—429.). Roget
Hoveden and Matthew Paris afford likewise
many valuable materials; and the former
describes, with accuracy, the discipline and
navigation of the English fleet.
