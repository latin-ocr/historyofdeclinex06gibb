OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

253

After some ages of oblivion‚ Greece was awakened to new mis· C Η A B.

fortunes by the arms of the Latins.

In the two hundred and fifty

years between the first and the last conquest of Constantinople, that
venerable land was disputed by a multitude of petty tyrants; with-
out the comforts of freedom and genius, her ancient citics were
again plunged in foreign: and intestine war3 and, is servitude be
preferable to anarchy, they might repose with joy under the. Turkish

yoke.

of ATHENS ⁵¹, would* argue a strange ingratitude to the first and purest
school of liberal science and amusement. In t-he partition of the em-
pire, the principality of Athens and Thebes was afligned to Otho
de la Roche, a noble warrior of Burgundy⁵², with the title of great
duke⁵³, which- the Latins understood in⁴ their own sense, and the
Greeks more foolishly derived from the-age of Constantine ⁵⁴. Otho
followed the standard of the marquis of Montferrat 3 the ample state

which he acquired by a mii-acle of conduct or fortune ⁵⁵, was peace-

pleasure, and which the Spaniards extol as a
model ofstyle and composition (Expedicion de
los Catalanes y Arragoneses contra Turcos y
Griegos; Banelona, 1623, in quarto; Madrid,
1777, in oftavo). Don Francisco de Mon-

records of the exploits of his countrymen⁴

⁵¹ See the labor-ious history of Ducange3
whose accurate table of the French dynasties,
recapitulates the thirty-five passages in which
he mentions the dukes of Athens.

⁵² He is twice mentioned by Villehardouin

with honour (N0151. 233.); and under the<

first passage, Ducange observes all that can
be known of his person and family.

⁵³ From these Latin princes of the xiv*-
century, Boccace, chancer, and SMkespeare,
have borrowed their Theseus duke of Athens.
An ignorant age transfers its own language
and manners to the most distant times.

⁵4 The same Constantine gave to Sicily a
king, to Ruffia the magnus daptfer Of the
empire, to Thebes the primicerius: and these
absurd fables are properly lassied by Ductnge
(ad Nicephor. Greg. 1. viiv c. 5.). By the
Latinssthe Lord of Thebes was styled by
corruption the Megas Kurios,‚or Grand Sirei

probably received by Michael'Choniates, the
archbistiop who had defended Athens against¹
the tyrant Leo Sgurus (Nicetas in Baldwino).
Michael was the. brother of the historiari
Nicetas; and his encomium of Athens is still
extant in MS. in the Bodleian library (Fan
