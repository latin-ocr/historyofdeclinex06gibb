THE DECMNE AND FALL

N Of the triangle which composes the figure of Constantinople, the
two fides along the sea were made inaeceffible to an tnemy; the
Propontis by nature, and the harbour by art. Between the two'
waters, the basis of the trianglc, the land fide was prote&ed by a
double wall, and a deep ditch of the depth of one hundred feet.
Against this line of fortification, which Plu-anza, an eye-witness,
prolongs to the measure of fix miles ³⁶, the Ottomans directed their
principal attack; and the emperor, after distributing the service and
command of the most perilous stations, under-took the defence of
the external wall. In the first days of the slege, the Greek soldiers
descended into the ditch, or sallied into the field ; but they soon dis-
covered, that, in the proportion of their numbers, one Christian
was of more value than twenty Turks: and, after these bold pre·-
ludes, they were prudently content to maintain the rampart with
their miffile weapons. Nor should this prudence be accused of pu·-
fillanimity. The nation was indeed pufillanimous and base3 but the

last Constantine deserves the name of an hero: his noble band of Α

volunteers was inspired with Roman virtue 3 and the foreign auxi-
liaries supported the honour of the Western chivalry. The inceffant
vollies of lances and arrows were accompanied with* the smoke, the
found, and the firc, of their musketry and cannon. Their smalh
arms discharged at the same time either five, or even ten, balls of
lead, of the fize of a walnut3 and, according to the closeness of
the ranks and the force of the powder, several breast-plates and
bodies were transpierced by the same ssiot. But the Turkisti ap-
proaches were soon sunl< in trenche-s‚ or covered with ruins. Each
day added to the science of the Christian33 but their inadequate stoek
of gunpowder was wasted in the operations of each day. Their
ordnance was not powerful, either in fize or number 3 and if they
