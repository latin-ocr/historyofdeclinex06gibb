THE DECLINE AND FALL

Five hundred years after Charlemagne‚ a

μων-...ι king of Sicily, Robert‚ the wisest and most liberal sovereign of the

age, was supplied with the same materials by the easy navigation of the
Tyber and the sea ; and Petrarch sighs an indignant complanat, that
the ancient capital of the world should adorn from her own bowels
the ssothful luxury of Naples³¹.

But these examples of plunder or

unenvied, might have applied to their private or public use the re-
maining strti&ures of antiquity, if in their present form and situa-
tion they had not been useless in a great measure to the city and
its inhabitants.

but the city had descended from the seven hills into the Campus
Martius ; and some of the noblest monuments which had braved

The walls still described the old circumference,

the injuries of time were left in a desert, far remote from the
habitations of mankind. The palaces of the senators were no longer

adapted to the manners or fortunes of their indigent succeffors: the

marmora) see the original grant of pope
Adrian l. to Charlemagne (Codex Carolin.

³⁰ 1 {hall quote the authentic testimony of
the Saxon poet (A. D. 887—899)‚ de Rebus
gestis Caroli magni, l. v. 437—440. in the
Historians of France (tom. ν. p. 180.):

Ad quae marmoreas praestabat ROMA columnas,
Qasdam praecipuas pulchra Ravenna dedit

De tam longinqui poterit regione vetustas-
Illius ornatum francia ferre tibi.

³¹ I cannot refuse to transcribe along pas-
sage of Petrarch (Opp. p. 536, 537. in Epistola
hortatoria ad Nicolaum Laurentium) ; it is so
strong and full to the point: Nec pudor aut
,pietas continuit quominus impii spoliata Dei

templa, occupatas arces, opes publicas re-
giones urbis, atque honores magistratuum in-
ter se divisos; (habeanff) quarn uni in re,
turbulenti ac seditiosi homines et totius reli·
quae vitae consiliis et rationibus discordes, in-
humani foederis stupenda societate convene-
rant, in pontes et moenia atque immeritos
lapides dcfieeirent. Denique post vi vel senio
collapsa palatia, quae quondam ingentes
tenuerunt viri, post diruptos arcus triurn-
phales (unde majores horum forfitan cor-
ruerunt), de ipsius vetustatis ac propriae im.
pietatis fragminibus vilem questum turpi
mercimonio captare non puduit. Itaque
nunc, heu dolor! heu scelus indignum! de
vestris marmoreis columnis, de liminibus tem-
plorum (ad quae nuper ex orbe toto concur-
sus devotissimus fiebat), de imaginibus se-
pulchrorum sub quibus patrum vestrorum ve-
nerabilis civis (ciniffl) erat, ut reliquas
sileam, defidiosa Neapolis adornatur. Sic
paullatim ruinae ipsse deficiunt. Yet king
Robert was the friend of Petrarch.
