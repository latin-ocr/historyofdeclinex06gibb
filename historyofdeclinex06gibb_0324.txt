306 THE DECLINE AND FALL

ε--γ-θ the places of religious worship, one Nestorian church‚ two moschs, and ss‘
twelve temples of various idols, may represent in some degree the ἑὲ
number and division of inhabitants. Yet a French miffionary declares». ἰ’ῗ.
that the town of St. Denys, near Paris, was more confiderable than· '
the Tartar capital 3 and that the whole palace of Mangou was scarcely ’ἔ
equal to a tenth part of that Benedictine abbey. The conquests of ξ
Ruffia and Syria might amuse the vanity of the great khans; but· ,
they were seated on the borders of China3 the acquisition of that:
empire was the nearest and most interesting objed'c3 and they might: >-
learn¹ from their pastoral oeconomy, that it is for the advantage of the L:

thirty years, this friend of his country and of mankind continually
laboured to mitigate, or suspend, the havoek of war; to save the monn-

commander by the restoration of civil magistrates; and to instill the
love of peace and justice into the minds of the Moguls. He struggled
with the barbarism of the first conquerors3 but his salutary leffons
produced a rich harvest in the second generation. The northern„ ι,
and by degrees the southern, empire, acquiesced in the government .
of Cubla’n the lientenant, and afterwards the successor, of Mangou 3-
and the nation was loyal to a prince who had been educated in the-
manners of China. He restored the forms of her venerable consti· .. Π
tution3 and the victors submitted to the laws, the fashions, and„ ’ J.
even the prejudices, of the vanquissied people. This peacefulss , '⁴
triumph, which has been more than once repeated, may be ascribed:
in a great measure to the numbers and servitude of the Chinese. The -· ζ
Mogul army was diffolved in a vast and populous country; and'
