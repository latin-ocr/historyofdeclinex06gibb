THE DECLINE Aur) FALL

and punishments, each case was supposed, each difference was re—
marked, by the experience or penetration of the monks ; some slus
are enumerated which innocence could not have suspe&ed, and
others which reason cannot believe3 and the more ordinary offences
of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of rapine and
murder, were expiated by a penance, which, according to the va-
rious circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven years.
During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the cri-

palace, the camp, and the city: the Barbarians of the West believed

of sms, an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion. A debt
of three hundred years, or twelve hundred pounds, was enough to
impoverish a plentiful fortune3 the scal-city of gold and filver was
supplied by the alienation of land3 and the princely donations of
