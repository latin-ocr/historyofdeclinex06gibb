OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

his title, he was reduced to fell or mortgage the best of his patri-
mony. By these expedients‚ the liberality of his royal kinsman
Philip Augustus, and the national spirit of chivalry, he was cnabled
to pass the Alps at the head of one hundred and forty knights, and
five thousand five hundred serjeants and archers. After some hesi—
tation, pope Honorius the third was persuaded to crown the suc-
