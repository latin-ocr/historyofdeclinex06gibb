502 THE DECLINE AND FALL

CLEiVilIP' While they expected the descent of the tardy angel, the doors

multitude of their prisoners. Youth‚ beauty‚ and the appearance of
wealth, attraCted their choice 3 and the right of property was decided
among themselves by a prior seizure‚ by personal strength, and by
