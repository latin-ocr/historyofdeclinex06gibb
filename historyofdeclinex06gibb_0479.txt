*retinue consisted of nobles and guards, of phyficians and monks; he
was attended by a band of music3 and the term of his costly eme
bassy was protracted above two years. On his arrival in Georgia
or Iberia, the natives from the towns and villages flocked around the
strangers; and such was their fimplicity‚ that they were delighted
with the effects, without understanding the cause, of musical har-
mony. Among the crowd was an old man, abovelan‘ hundred
years of age, who had formerly been carried away a captive by the
Barbarians⁴⁹‚ and who amused his hearers with a tale of the won-

ders of India ⁵⁰, from whence he had returned to Portugal by an
unknown sea⁵¹. From this hospitable land, Phranza proceeded to
the court of Trebizond, where he was informed by the Greek prince
of the recent decease of Amurath. Instead of rejoicing in the deli-
verance, the experienced statefman expreffed his apprehenfion, that
an ambitious youth would not long adher-e to the sage and p'acific
system of his father. After the sultan's decease‚ his Christian wife
Maria ⁵², the daughter of the Servian despot, had been honourably re-

the old and incompatible error which places
the source ofthe Nile 'm India.
