the Greek tongue; and national vanity has been loud in the praise
of such rare examples of erudition. without scrutinizing the merit
of individuals, truth must observe that their science is without a
cause, and without an effedig that it was easy for them to satisfy
themselves and their more ignorant contemporaries3 and that the
idiom, Which they had so marvelloufly acquired, was transcribed in
few manuscripts, and was not taught in any universlty of the West.
In a corner of Italy, it faintly existed as the popular, or at least as
the ecclesiastical‚ dialect ⁸⁶. The first impreffion of the Doric and
Ionic colonies has never been completely erazed: the Calabrian
churches were long attached to the throne of Constantinople3 and
the monks of St. Bassl pur-sued their studies in mount Athos and the

schools of the East. Calabria was the native country of Barlaam,
who has already appeared as a sectary and an ambassador 3 and Bar-
