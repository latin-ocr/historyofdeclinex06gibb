c-v--e In his rapid progress, he overran the kingdomS, as they are now

styled, of Astracan and Cazan; and the troops which he detached
towards mount Caucasus, explored the most secret receffes of Georgia
and Cireaffia. The civil discord of the great dukes, or princes, of
Ruffia, betrayed their country to the Tartars. They spread from
Livonia to the Black Sea, and both Moseow and Kiow, the modern
and the ancient capitals‚ were reduced to ashes; a temporary ruin,
less fatal than the deep, and perhaps indelible‚ mark, which a ser-
vitude of two hundred years, has imprinted on the characier of the
Ruffians. The Tartars ravaged with equal fury the countries which
they hoped to possess, and those which they were hastened to leave.
From the permanent conquest of Ruffia, they made a deadly, though
tranfient, inroad into the heart of Poland, and as far as the borders
of Germany. The cities of Lublin and Cracow were obliterated:
they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in the battle of Lignitz,
they defeated the dukes of Silena, the Polish palatines, and the great
master of the Teutonic order, and filled nine sacks with the right-
ears of the ssain. From Lignitz, the extreme point of their western
march, they turned afide to the invafion of Hungary ; and the pre..
sence or spirit of Batou inspired the host of five hundred thousand
men: the Carpathian hills could not be long impervious to their

divided columns; and their approach had been fondly disbelieved
till it was irrefistibly felt. The king, Bela the fourth, afl'embled the
military force of his counts and bishops: but he had alienated the
nation by adopting a vagrant hord of forty thousand families of
Comans, and these savage guests were provoked to revolt by the
suspicion of treachery and the murder of their prince. The whole
country north of the Danube was lost in a day, and depopulated in
a summer; and the ruins of cities and cburches were overspread
