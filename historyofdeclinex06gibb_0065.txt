supposed to be defended by the river, the morass, and the moun-
tains. Notwithstanding these fortifications, the city had been re..
peatedly taken by the Perfians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the
Turks ; so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of
attack; and in a siege that was formed about the middle of Oc‘tober,
the vigour of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the
attempt. Whatever strength and valour could perform in the field
was abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the
frequent occafions of sanies, of forage, of the attack and defence of
convoys, they were often vidtorious5 and we can only complain,
that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the scale of pro-
bability and truth. The sword of Godfrey⁹¹ divided a Turk from

the shoulder to the haunch3 and one half of the infidel fell to the
ground, while the other was transported by his horse to the city

gate. As Robert of Normandy rode against his antagonist, “ I de-

of such gigantic provvess ⁹² must have taught the Mossems to keep
within their wa11s3 and against those walls of earth or stone, the
sword and the lance were unavailing weapons. In the ssow and
succeffive labours of a siege, the crusaders were supine and ignorant,
without sszill to contrive, or money to purchase, or industry to use,
