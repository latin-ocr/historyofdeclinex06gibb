East. The patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the succes-

‘⁶ martial nations of Europe in your cause ;'’ and Europe was obe-
dient to the callos the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismiffed
him with epistles of credit and complaint, and no sooner did he
land at Bari, than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman
pontifl‘. His stature was small, his appearance contemptible3 but
his eye was keen and lively; and he possessed that vehemence of
speech, which seldom fails to impart the persuafion of the soul².
He was born of a gentleman’s family (for we must now adopt a
modern idiom)‚ and his military service was under the neighbouring
counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the first crusade. But he soon re·
linquished the sword and the world3 and if it be true, that his wife,
however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with the
less reluC’tance, from her bed to a convent, ancl at length to an her-
mitage. In this austere solitude, his body was emaciated, his fancy
was inflamed3 whatever he withed, he believed; whatever he be-
lieved, he saw in dreams and revelations. From Jerusalem, the pil-
grim returned an accompliffied fanatic; but as he excelled in the
popular madness of the times, pope Urban the second received him
as a prophet, applauded his glorious design, promised to support it
in a general council‚ and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance
of the Holy Land. Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff,¹
his zealous miflionary traversed, with speed and success, the provinces
of Italy and Franee. His diet was abstemious‚ his prayers long and
fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand, he distri·-

applied to the quarrelsome humour of persona contemptibilis, vivacis ingenii, et
