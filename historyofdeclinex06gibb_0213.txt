OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

displayed the virtues both of peace and war. Under his discipline C ῙΕΧῩ P.

the swords of the French mercenaries were the most effectual instru· 2—-w-—1

ment of his conquests, and their desertion from the service of their
country was at once a symptom and a cause of the rising ascendant
of the Greeks. By the construffion of a fleet, he obtained the
command of the Hellespont, reduced the issands of Lesbos and
Rhodes, attacked the Venetians of Candia, and intercepted the rare
and parfimonious succours of the West. Once, and once only, the
Latin emperor sent an army against Vataces; and in the defeat
of that army, the veteran knights, the last of the original eonquerors,
were left on the field of battle. But the success of a foreign ene-
my was less painful to the pufillanimous Robert than the insolence

of his Latin subje&s, who confounded the weakness of the emperor
and of the empire. His personal misfortunes will prove the anarchy
of the government and the ferociousness of the times. The amor·
ous youth had neglected his Greek bride, the daughter of Vataces,
to introduce into the palace a beautiful maid, of a private, though
noble, family of Artois; and her mother had been tempted by the
lustre of 'the purple to forfeit her engagements with a gentleman of
Burgundy. His love was converted into rage3 he affembled his

' friends, forced the palace gates, threw the mother into the sea, and

inhumanly cut off the nose and lips of the wife or concubine of
the emperor. Instead of punishing the offender, the barons avowed
and applauded the savage deed ³⁸, which, as a prince and as a man,

it was impoffihle that Baldwin should forgive. He escaped from the

guilty city to implore the justice or compaflion of the pope: the ems-
perot was coolly exhorted to return to his station3 before he could

obey, he sunk under the weight of grief, ffiame, and impetent re-
sentment ³⁹.
