from his silver-mines ¹⁷3 and his family is celebrated by the Greeks

as the most ancient and noble of the Teutonic name¹⁸.

After the

death of this childless princess, Andronicus fought in marriage Jane,

the fister of the count of Savoy’

that of the French king ²⁰.

¹4 Agnes, or Irene, was the daughter of
duke Henry the Wond'erful, the chief of the

⁴ house of Brunswick‚ and the fourth in de—

scent from the famous Henry the Lion, duke
of Saxony and Bavaria, and conqueror of the
Slavi on‚the Baltic coast. Her brother Henry

was surnamed the Greek, from his two jour-
nies into the East: but these journies were
subsequent tothis sister's marriage; and I am
ignorant how Agnes was discovered in the
heart of Germany, and recommended to the
Byzantine court (Rimiue, Memoirs of the
House ofBrunswick, p. ¹26-137·)·

¹⁵ Henry the Wonderful was the founder
of the branch of Grubenhagen‚ exxin& in
the year 1596 (Rimius, p. 287.). He refided
in the came of WVolfenbutteL and possessed
no more than a fixth part of the allodial
estates of Brunswick and Luneburgh, which
the Guelph family had saved from the confis-
cation of their great fiess. The frequent par-
titions among brothers, had almost ruined the
princely houses of Germany, till that just, but
pernicious, law was ssowly superseded by the
right of primogeniture. The principality of
Grubenhagen, one of the last remains of the
Hercynian forest, is a woody‚ mountainous‚
and barren tra& (Busching’s Geography,
vol. vi. p. 270-286. English transsation).

²⁶ The royal author of the Mernoirs of
Brandenburgh will 'teach us, how justly, in a
much later period, the north of Germany
deserved the epithets of poor and barbarous
(Effai sur les Moeurs, &c.). In the year
1306, in the woods of Luneburgh‚ some
wild people of the Vened race were allowed

to bury alive their infirm and useless parents
(Rimius, p. 136).

¹⁷ The ass‘ertion of Tacitus. that Germany
was destitute of the precious metals, must be
taken, even in his own time, with some limit-
ation (Germania, c. ς. Annal. xi. 20.)-
According to Spener (Hist. Germaniae Prag-
marica, tom. i. p. 35¹0, Argenttfidinae in
Hercyniis montibus, imperante Othone mag:
no (A. D. 968) primum apertae, largam
etiam opes augendi dederunt copiam: but
Rimius (p. 255, 259.) defers till the year
1016 the discovery of the silver mines of
Grubenhagen‚ or the Upper Hartz, which
were produffive in the beginning of the >jum
century, and which still yield a considerable
revenue to the house of Brunswick.>

¹²³ Cantacuzene has given a most honour-

able testimony, ἠν dem safkavm οἱυτη θυγατηρ ”

&mog m μπμςζεμ. (the modern Greeks employ
the ss for the ἒ, and the μη for the ἒ, and the
whole will read in the Italian idiom di Brun-
zuic), ‘re παρ’ aurore επιφανεςτιτε, και >sapen-parma

praise is just in itself, and pleafing to an Ετηὲῗ

¹⁹ Anne, or Jane, was one of the four
daughters of Amedee the Great, by a second
marriage, and hals sister of his successor Ed-
ward count of Savoy (Anderson’s Tables,
p. 659·)· See Cantacuzene (l. i. c. 40—42.).

2⁰ That king, if the fact be true, must
have been Charles the Fair, who in five years
(1321—1326) was married to three wives
(Anderson, p. 628.). Anne of Savoy ar-
rived at Constantinople in February 1326.
