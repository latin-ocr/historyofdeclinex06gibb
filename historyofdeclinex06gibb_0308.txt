His laws.

The ambition of Temugin condescended to employ the'
arts of superstition ς and it was from a naked prophet, who could
ascend to heaven on a white horse, that he accepted the title of
Zingis³‚ the ⁷77?st great ; and a divine right to the conquest and
dominion of the earth. In a general com-oullczi‚ or diet, he was
seated on a felt, which was long afterwards revered as a relic, and
solemnly procl-aimed great khan, or emperor, of the Moguls*
and Tartars ⁵.
had given birth to the Imperial race3 and the latter has been
emended, by accident or error, over the spacious wilderness of the·

north.
The code of laws which Zingis dietated to his subjed’cs, was

adapted to the preservation of domestic peace, and the exercise of

foreign hostility. The punishment of death was inflicted on the
crimes of adulter-y, murder, perjury, and the capital thefts of an

horse or 0³13 and the fiercest of men were· mild and just in their

intercourse with each other. The future election of the great khan
was vested in thc princes of his family and the heads of 'the tribe-33
and the regulations of the chace were effential to the pleasures and
plenty of a Tartar camp. The victorious nation was held sacred¹

descended from Tatar Khan, the brother of'
Mogul Khan (sce Abulghnzi, part i and ii.)‚
and once formed a hord of 70‚000 families
oti-the borders of Kitay (p. 103—112›.). In
