‘THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

The studente, os

u--v-——a the inore perse& idionis of Rome and (ja-ecce, were introduced to

a new world of light and science3 to the society of the free and
polissied nations of antiquity3 and to a familiar converse with those
immortal men who spoke the sublime language of eloquence and
reason. Such an intercourse must tend to resine the tasse, and to
elevate the genius, of the moderna: and yet, from the first experi—
ment‚ it might appear that the stndy of the ancients had given fet-
terS, rather than wings, to the human mind. Hoxvever laudable,
the spirit of imitation is of a servile cast3 and the first disciples of
the Greeks and Romans were a colony of strangers in the midst of
their nge and country. The minute and laborious diligence which
explored the antiquities of remote times, might have improved or
adorned the present state of society: the critic and metaphysician
vvere the ssaves cf Aristotle3 the poem, historiam, and orators, were
proud to repeat the thoughts and words of the Augustam age; the

strength and number of their ancient auxiliaries: the century after the
deaths of Petrarch and Boccace was filled with a crowd of Latin imi-
tators‚ who decently repose on our shelves3 but in that aera of learn-
ing, it vvill not be easy to discern a real discovery of science, a work
of invention or eloquence, in the popular language of the country¹¹⁶.

¹¹⁷ I will sele& three singular examples of
this classic enthufiasm. 1. At the synod of
Florence, Gemistus Pletho said, in familiar
conversation to George of Trebizond, that in
a {hort time mankind would unanirnoussy re-
nounce the Gospel and the Koran for a reli-
gion similar to :hat of the Gentiles (Leo Al-
latius‚ apud Fabricium, tom. x. p. 751.)-
2. Paul ΙΙ. persecuted the Roman academy,
which had been founded by Pomponius Iae-
tus; and the principal-members were accused
oflieresyfimpiety, and [agamfin (Tiraboschi,
zom- vi. P.i.p. 81,82.). 3. In thencmcentury,

some scholar-s and poets in France celebrated
the success of Jodelle’s tragedy of Cleopatra,
by a festival ofBacchus, and as it is said, by

the sacrifice of a goat (Byle, Diffioufflre, “

JonELLE. *Fonrenenessom iii. p. 56-61.).
‚Yet the spirit of bigotry might often discern
a serious impiety in the sportive play of fancy
and learning.

¹¹⁸ The survivor Boccace died in the year
1375 ; and we cannot place before 1480, the
composition of the Morgante Maggiore' of
Porci, and the Orlando Inamorato of Boyardo
(Tiraboschi, tom-vi. P.ii. p. 174-···¹77·)·
