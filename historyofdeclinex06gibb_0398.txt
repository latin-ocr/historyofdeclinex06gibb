THE DECLINE AND FALL

‘⁴ meeting. For this salutary end, it will be expedient, and even
“ necessary, that a well-cholen legate should be* sent into Grec-tce,
“ to convene the patriarchs of Constantinople‚ Alexandria, Andoch,
“ and Jerusalem3 and, with their aid, to prepare a free and uni-
“versal synod. But at this moment‚'' continued the subtle agent,
“ the empire is affaulted and endangered by the Turks, who have
“ occupied four of the greatest cities of Anatolia. The Christian
‘⁶ inhabitants 'have expreffed a wish of returning to their allegiance
“ and religion 3 but the forces and revenues of the emperor are in-
“ sufficient for their deliverance: and the Roman legate must be
“ accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to expel the
“ infidels, and open a way to the holy sepulchre.'' If the 'suspicions
Latius should require some pledge, some previous effe& of the fin-

cerity of the Greeks, the answers of Barlaam were perspicuous and
rational. “ 1. A general synod can alone consummate the union

“ of the churches; nor can such a synod be held till the three Orien-
“ tal patriarchs‚ and a great number of bissiops, are enfranehised
“ from the Mahometan yoke. 2. The Greeks are alienated by ᾳ

“ long series of oppreflion and injury : they must be reconciled by
λ( some a& of brotherly love, some effefiual succcur, which may

“ for-tify the authority and argu1nent8‚ of the emperor, and the
‘⁶‘ friends of the union. 3. If some difference of faith or ceremonies
“ ssiould be found incurable‚ the Greeks however are the disciples
“ of Christ 3 and the Turks are the common enemies of the Chris-
“ tian name. The Armeniam, Cyprians, and Rhodiam, are equally
“ ,attacked3 and it will become the piety of the French princes to
“ draw their swords in the general defence of religion. 4. Should
“ the subjecte, of Andronicus be treated as the worst of schismatics‚
“ of heretics, of pagans, a judicious policy may yet instruct the
‘⁶ powers of the West to embrace an useful ally, to uphold a finking
“ empire, to guard the confines of Europe; and rather to join the

“ Greeks against the Turks, than to expe& the union of the Turkish
“ arms
