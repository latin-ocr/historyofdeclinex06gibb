THE DECLINE AND FALL

turers. Ι. The first rank both in war and council is justly due to
Godfrey of Bouillon3 and happy would it have been for the cru-
luders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole condit& of that
:tecomplilhed hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from
whom he was descended in the female line. His father was of the
noble race of the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province
of Lorraine⁴³, was the inheritance of his mother3 and by the em·-
peror's bounty, he was himself invested with that ducal title, which
has been improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the
Ardennes⁴⁴. In the service of Henry the fourth, he bore the great
standard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the breast of
Rodolph‚ the rebel king: Godfrey was the first who ascended the
walls of Rome ; and his fickness, his vow, perhaps his remorse for

bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early resolution of
viliting the holysepulchre, not as a pilgrim‚ but a deliverer. His
valour was matured by prudence and moderation3 his piety, though
blind, was smeere3 and, in the tumult of a camp, he praetised the
real and fiCtitious virtues of a convent. Superior to the private fac-
tions of the chiefs‚ he reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ;
and though he gained a kingdom by the attempt, his pure and difin-
terested zeal was acknowledged by his rivale. Godfrey of Bouillon ⁴⁵
was accompanied by his two brothers, by Eustace the elder, who had
succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin,
ἃ chara&er of more ambiguous virtue. The duke of Lorraine was
alike celebrated on either fide of the Rhine: from his birth and edu-
cation he was equally conversant with the French and Teutonic
