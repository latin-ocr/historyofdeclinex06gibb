OF THE RoMAN EMPIRE. 491

accessible: an impenetrable chain was now defended by eight large (ἵῶκένῶ Ρ·
ships, more than twenty of a smaller slze, with several gallies and Q}
ssoops ; and, instead of forcing this bai-rier, the Turks might appre-
hend a naval sally, and a second encounter in the open sea. In this
perplexity, the genius of Mahomet conceived and executed a plan
of a bold and marvellous cast, of transporting by land his lighter
veffels and military stores from the Bosphorus into the higher part
of the harbour. The distance is about ten miles; the ground is
uneven, and was overspread with thickets ; and, as the road must

be opened behind the suburb of Galata, their free passage or total

destruction must depend on the option of the Genoese. But these
selfissi merchants were ambitious of the favour of being the last
devoured ; and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of
obedient myriads. A level way was covered with a broad platform
of strong and solid planks; and to render them more ssippery and
smooth, they were anointed with the fat of ssieep and oxen. Four-
score light 'gallies and brigantines of fifty and thirty oarS‚ were dis-
embarked on the Bosphorus shore ; arranged succeffively on rolle1·s;
and drawn forwards by the power of men and pullies. Two guides
or pilots were stationed at the helm, and the prow, of each veffel;
the sails were unfurled to the winds3 and the labour was cheered by
song and acclamation. In the course ofa single night, this Turkissi
fieet painfully climbed the hill, steered over the plain, and was
launched from the declivity into the stiallow waters of the harbour,
far above the molestation of the deeper vcss'els of the Greeks. The
real importance of this operation was magnified by the consternation
and eonfidence which it inspired : 'but the notorious, unquestionable,
