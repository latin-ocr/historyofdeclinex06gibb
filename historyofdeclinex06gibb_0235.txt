his son, if the youth could have renounced, for any tempor-al interest,
the right and title of a legitimate prince of the blood of France⁷⁹.

III. According to the old register of Ford Abbey, the Courtenays ΙΙΙ. The

Courtenaya

of Devonssiire are descended from prince Florus, the second son of offingland..

Peter, and the grandson of Louis the lsat⁸⁰. This fable of the grate-
ful or venal monks was too respeffitfully entertained by our anti-
quaties, Cambden⁸¹ and Dugdale⁸²z but it is so clearly repugnant to
truth and time, that the rational pride of the family now refuses to
accept this imaginary founder. Their most faithful historians believe,
that after giving his daughter to the king’s son, Reginald of Cour-
tenay abandoned his poffeffions in Franee, and obtained from the
English monarch a second wife and a new inheritance, It is cer-
tain‚ at least, that Heni-y the second distinguished in his camps and
couneils, a Reginald, of the name and arms, and, as it may bc
fairly presumed, of the genuine race, of the Courtenays of France.
The right of wardssiip enabled a feudal lord to reward his vaffal with
the marriage and estate of a noble heiress ; and Reginald of Cour-
tenay acquired a fair establissiment in Devonssiire, where his posterity

has been seated above fix hundred years⁸‘. From a Norman baron,
Baldwin

was Helene de Courtenay, who married
Louis de Beaufremont. Her title of Princess‘e
du Sang Royal de France‚ was suppressed
(February 7²¹¹, 1737) by an arret of the par-
liament of Paris.

⁷⁹ The fingular anecdote to which 1 allude,
is related in the Recueil des Pieces interes-
santes et'peu connues (Maestricht, 1786, in
4 vols. 12¹¹¹⁰) ; and the unknown editor
quotes his author, who had received it from
Helene de Com-tenay, marquise de Beaufre-
mont.

p.786. Yet this fable must have been in-
vented before the reign of Edward 111. The
profuse devotion of the three first generations

to Ford abbey‚ was followed by oppreffion
on one fide and ingratitude on the other;
and in the fixth generatim, the monks ceased
to register the births‚ affions, and deaths of
their patrons.

have corressed the register of Ford abbey,
and annihilated the phantom Florus, by the
unquestionable evidence of the French histo-
