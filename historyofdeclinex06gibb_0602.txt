THE DECLINE AND FALL

With equal presumption the tribune watched or

bar—³ reposed within the consecrated precinc‘ts of the baptistery3 and the

failure of his state-bed was interpreted as an omen of his approach-
At the hour of worship he shewed himself to the re-
turning crowds in a majestic attitutle, with a robe of purple, his

his levity and insolence. Rising from his throne, and advancing
towards the congregation, he proclaimed in a loud voice: “ We

is extant in Hocsemius (Cerceau, p. 163—
