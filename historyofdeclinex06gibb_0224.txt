THE DECLINE AND FALL

“ emperors of the Romans !'' Their rival, Baldvvin‚ was awakened
by the sound; but the most preffing danger could not prompt him
to draw his sword in the defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps,
with more pleasure than regret: he fied from the palace to the sea-
shore, where he descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning
from the vain and fruitless attempt on Daphnufia. Constantinople
was irrecoverably lost; but the Latin emperor and the principal fa-
milies embarked on board the Venetian gallies, and steered for the
isse of Euboea, and afterwards for Italy, where the royal fugitive
was entertained by the pope and Sicilian king with a mixture of
contempt and pity. From the loss of Constantinople to his death,
he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the Catholic powers tojoin in
his restoration5 the leffon had been familiar to his youth; nor was
his last exile more indigent or ssiameful than his three former pil-
grimages to the courts of Europe. His son Philip was the heir of
an ideal empire; and the pretenfions of his daughter Catherine were
transported by her marriage to Charles of Valois, the brother of
Philip the Fair king of France. The house of Courtenay was repre-
sented in the female line by succeffive alliances, ⁴till the title of em-
peror of Constantinople‚ too bulky and sonorous for a private name,
modestly expired in silence and oblivion⁶².

on the nations that were the aetors, of these memorable crusades ⁶³.
