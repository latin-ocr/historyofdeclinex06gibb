weighty and substantial kind ; yet by the Orientale the Roman 2--w--t

bishop had ever been respected as the first of the five patriarch83

nor did they scruple to admit, that his jmisdiffion should be exercised

agreeable to the holy canons3 a vague assowance, which might be

defined or eluded by occafional convenience. The proceffion of the

Holy Ghost from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son,
was an article of saith which had sunl< much deeper into the minds of
men3 and in the seffions of Ferrara and Florence, the Latin addition
of filioque was subdivided into two questions, whether it were legal, and
whether it were orthodox. Perhaps it may not be necessary t'o boast
on this subje& of my own impartial indifference3 but I must think that
the Greeks were strongly supported by the prohibition of the council
of Chalcedon, against adding any article whatsoever to the creed of
Nice, or rather of Constantinople⁶³. In earthly affairs, it is not easy
to conceive how an affembly of legissators can bind their succeffors
invested with powers equ'al to their own. But the dictates of inspi-
ration must be true and unchangeable ; nor should a private bishop,
or a provincial synod, have presumed to innovate against the judg-
ment of the Catholic church. On the substance of the doEtrine, the
controversy was equali and endless : reason is confounded by the pro-
cession of a deity; the gospel, which lay on the altar, was filent;
the various texts of the fathers might be corrupted by fraud or en-
tangled by sophistry ; and the Greeks were ignorant of the cha-
radlers and writings of the Latin saints ⁶⁴. Of this at least we may
be sure, that neither fide could be convinced by the arguments of
their opponents. Prej‘udice may be enlightened by reason, and a
superficial glauce may be renified by a clear and more persen view
