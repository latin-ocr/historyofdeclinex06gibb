tribes, who had so often insulted the majesty of the empire, were
repeatedly broken by his destrufflve inroads. Their countries did
not abound either in gold or filver3 nor were their rustic hamlets
and townssiips enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of
luxury. But the natives of the soil have been distinguished in every
age bys their hardiness of mind and body 3 and they were converted
by a prudent institution into the firmest and most faithful supporters
