Christendom. The Janizaries fought with the zeal of proselytes
against their idolatrous countrymen3 aud in the battle of Coffova,
the league and independence of the Sclavonian tribes was finally
crussied. As the conqueror walked over the field, he observedwhat
the greatest part of the ssain consisted of beardless youths ; and list-
ened to the flattering reply of his vizir, that age and wisdom would
have taught them not to oppose his irrefistible arms. But the sword

of his Janizaries could not defend him from the dagger of despair;
a Servian soldier started from the crowd of dead bodies, and Amurath

was pierced in the belly with a mortal wound. The grandson of

Othman was mild in his temper, modest in his apparel, and a lover
of learning and virtue3 but the Mossems were scandalised at his ab-
sence from public worship3 and he was corredied by the firmness
of the mufti, who dared to reje& his testimony in a civil cause: a
mixture of servitude and freedorn not unfrequent in Oriental his-

and Mahometan princes of Europe and Afia. From Angora to
