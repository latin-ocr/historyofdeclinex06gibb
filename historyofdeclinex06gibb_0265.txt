OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

On the vigil of Easter, a proceffion of the disarmed citizens vifited
a church without the walls; and a noble damsel vvas rudely insulted
bya French soldier ⁴². The raviffier was instantly punilhed with
death3 and if the people was at first scattered by a military soi-ce,
their numbers and fury prevailed: the conspirators seized the op-
portunity; the flame spread over the issand; and eight thousand

French were exterminated in a promiscuous maffacrc, which has ob-

tained the name of the SICILIAN VESPERS ⁴³. From every city

the banners of freedom and the church were displayed: the revolt
was inspired by the presence or the soul of Procida ; and Peter of
Arragon, who sailed from the African coast to Palermo, was saluted
as the king and saviour of the isse. By the rebellion of a people
on whom he had so long trampled with impunity‚ Charles was
astonished and confounded3 and in the first agony of grief and de-
votion, he was heard to exclaim, “ Ο God! if thou has decreed to
“ humble me, grant me at least a gentle and gradual descent from
‘⁴ the pinnacle of greatness!'’ His fleet and army, which already
filled the sea-ports of Italy, vvere hastily recalled from the service of
the Grecian war ; and the situation of Meffina exposed that town to
the first storm of his revenge. Feeble in themselves, and yet hope-
less of foreign succour, the citizens would have repented, and sub-
mitted on the affurance of full pardon and their ancient privileges.
But the pride of the monarch was already rekindled 3 and the most
fervent intreaties of the legate could extort no more than a promise,
that he would forgive the remainder, after a chosen list of eight
hundred rebels had been yielded to his discretion. The despair of
the Meffinese renewed their courage ε Peter of Arragon approached

country, Nicholas Specialis adds, in the true member this bloody less‘on: “ If I am pro-
spirit of Italian jeanusy, Qae omnia et “ voked (said Henry the fourth), I will
graviora quidem, ut arbitror, patienti animo “ breakfast at Milan, and dine at Naples.’'
