600 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ὲῖχέ Ρ· the summer-beate permitted a decent escape from the city. But
ι-..γ--ν as soon as they were united at Anagni and Fundi, in a place of se-
curity‚ they cast afide the massz, accused their own falsehood and
hypocrisy, excommunicated the apostate and antichrist of Rome,
{lltgssiffiffu and proceeded to a new ele-{tion of Robert of Geneva, Clement
sept. 21. the sewum, whom they announeed to the nations as the true and
rightful vicar of Christ. Their first choice, an involuntary and ille-
gal ao, was annulled by the sear of death and the menaces of the
Romans3 and their complaint is justified by the strong evidence of
probability and fact. The twelve French cardinals, above two-thirds
of the votes, were masters of the eleffion; and whatever might be
“their provincial jealoufies‚ it cannot fairly be presumed that they
would have sacrificet} their right and interest to a foreign candidate,
who would never restore them to their native country. In the va-
rioms, and often inconsistent, narratives⁶⁶‚ the ssiades of popular
violence are more darkly οι· faintly coloured: but the licentiousness
of the {editions Romans was inflamed by a sense of their privilegeS,
and the danger of a second emigration. The conclave was intimi-
dated by the ssiouts, and encompafl'ed by the arms, of thirty thou-
sand rebels3 the bells of the Capitol and St. Peter's rang an alarm3
“ Death, or an Italian pope !'’ was the universal cry3 the same
threat was repeated by the twelve bannerets or chiefs of the quartem,
in the form of charitable advice; some preparatione were made for
burning the obstinate cardina153 and had they chosen a Transalpine

subjeet, it is probable that they would never have departed alive
from the Vatican. The same constraint imposed the neceffity of
diffembling in the eyes of Rome and of the world: the pride and
cruelty of Urban presented a more inevitable danger3 and they soon
discovered the features of the tyrant, who could wulk in his garden
