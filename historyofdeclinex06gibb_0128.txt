THE DECLINE AND FALL

relic os the tme cross. The failure may in some measure be ascribed

to the abuse and multiplicatiori of the crusades‚ which were preachcd

at the same time against the Pagans of Livonia, the Moors of Spain,

the Albigeois of France, and the kings of Sicily, of the Imperial

family ⁸⁶. In these meritorious services, the volunteers might acquire

at home the same spiritual indulgence, and a larger measure of tem-

poral rewards; and even the popes, in their zeal against a domestic

enemy, were sometimes tempted to forget the distress of their Syrian

bretliren. From the last age of the crusades they derived the oc-
›cafional command of an army and revenue3 and some deep rea-
soners have suspeffited that the whole enterprise, from the first synod of
Placentia, was contrived and executed by the policy of Rome. The
suspicion is not founded, either in nature or in fact. The sueceffors
rof St. Peter appear to have followed, rather than guided‚ the impulse
of manners and prejudice; without much forefight of the seasons, or
cultivation of the soil, they gathered the ripe and spontaneous fruits
of the superstition of the times. They gathered these fruits without
toil or personal danger: in the council of the Lateran‚ Innocent the
third declared an ambiguous resolution of animating the crusaders by
his example3 but the pilot of the sacred veffel could not abandon
the helm; nor was Palestine ever bleffed with the presence of
a Roman pontiff ⁸⁷.

The persons, the families, and estates of the pilgrims, were under
the immediate p-rotetition of the popes; and these spiritual patrons
soon claimed the prerogative of directing th'eir operations, and en·-
forcing‚ by commands and censures, the accompliihment of their
vow. Frederic the second⁸³‚ the grandson of Barbarossa, was suc-
