Q by an equal combat of ten or an hundred warriors. Instead of ae—
cepting this bold defianee‚ the emperor Michael, the son and colleague
of Andronicus, resolved to oppress them with the weight of mul-

with the ships of the Greeks and Genoese. In two battles by sea

the proteffiiion of the open country. Vif'tory renewed tlie hopes
and numbers of the adventurers: every nation¹ was blended under
the name and standard of the great company ,· and three thousand
Turkish proselytes deserted from the Imperial service to join this
military association. In the poffeffion of Gallipoli, the Catalans
intercepted the trade of Constantinople and the Black Sea, while
they spread‘ their devastations on either side of 'the Hellespont over
