THE DECLINE AND FALL

These preludes of conquest were easy and bloodless; the Greeks of
the provinces, without pati-iotism or cour-age, were cruthed by an
irrefistible force3 the presence of the lawful heir might justify their
obedience3 and it was rewarded by the modesty and discipline of
the Latins. As they penetrated through the Hellespont, the mag-
nitude of their navy was compressed in a narrow channel3 and the
face of the waters was darkened with innumerable sails. They again
expanded in the basori of the Propontis, and traversed that placid
sea, till they approached the European ssiore, at the abbey of St.
Stephen‚ three leagues to the west of Constantinople. The prudent
doge diffuaded them from dispersmg themselves in a populous and
hostile land3 and, as their stock of provisions was reduced, it was
resolved, in the season of harvest, to replenish their storeships in
the fertile issands of the Propontis. With this resolution, they di-
re6'oed their course; but a strong gale, and their own -impatience,
drove them to the eastward ; and so near did they run to the shore
and the city, that some vollies of stones and darts were exchanged
between the strips and the rampart. As they paffed along, they gazed
with admiration on the capital of the East, or, as it should seem,
of the earth3 rising from her seven hills, and towering over the
continents of Europe and Asia. The swelling domes and lofty
spires of five hundred palaces and churches, were gilded by the sun
and reflec'ted in the waters ; the walls were crowded with soldiers
and spedtators, whose numbers they beheld‚ of whose temper they
were ignorant; and each heart was ch-illed by the refleetion, that,
slnce the beginning of the world, such an enterprise had never been
undet-taken by such an handful of warriors. But the momentary
apprehension was dispelled by hope and valour; and every man,
