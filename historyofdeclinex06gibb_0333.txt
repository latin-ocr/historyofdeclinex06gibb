dom provoked, and repelled‚ the arms of the Turks and Saracens.
The Greeks, by their intestine divifions, were the authors of their
final ruin. During the civil wars of the elder and younger Andro-
nicus, the son of Othman atelfieved, almost without refistance, the
conquest of Bithynia; and the same disorders encouraged the Turkirh
emirs of Lydia and Ionia to build a fleet, and to pillage the adjacent
issands and the sea-coast of Europe. In the defence of his life and
honour, Cantacuzene was tempted to prevent, or imitate, his acl-

and country. Amir, the son of Aidin, concealed under a Turkish
