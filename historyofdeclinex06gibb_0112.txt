saints; and the constant meditation of the holy war appears to have
ssied a serious and sober colour over their lives and actions. The
youth of the latter sswas addicted to wine and women3 but his
aspiring spirit soon renounced the temptations of pleasure‚ for the
graver follies of fame and dominion: the garment of Saladin was
a coarse woollen; water was his only drink3 and, while he emulated

each day, the sultan devoutly prayed with his brethren: the invo-

ministers ; and it was only for a kingdom that Saladin would deviate
from the rule of equity. While the descendants of Seljuk and Zenghi
