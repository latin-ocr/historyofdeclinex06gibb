his elegant philosophy3 his style is the purest standard of the Attio

conversation, and sometimes adorned with the richest colours of
poetry and eloquence. The dialogues of Plato are a dramatic picture
of the life and death ofa sage; and, as often as he descende from
the clouds, his moral system inculcates the love of truth‚ of our

method of the Peripatetie school. So equal‚ yet so oppofite, are the
merits of Plato and Aristotle, that they may be balanced in endless
controversy3 but some ‘spark of freedom may be 'produced by the

collision of adverse servitude. The modern Greeks were divided
between the two secls: with more fury than sszill they fought under
