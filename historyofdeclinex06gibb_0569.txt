privilege: the parochial clergy of Rome obtained the first rank in

the hierarchy3 they were indifferently chosen among the nations of
Christendom 3 and the poffession of the richest benefices, of the most

important bishoprics, was not incompatible with their title and office.

the supreme pontiff, were robed in purple, the symbol of martyrdom

or royalty3 they claimed a proud equality with kings5 and their

dignity was enhaneed by the smallness of their number, which, till

the reign of Leo the tenth, seldom exceeded twenty, or twenty-five,

persons. By this wife regulation, all doubt and scandal were re-

moved, ‘and the root of schism was so effeetually destroyed, that in

a period of six hundred years a double choice has only once divided

the unity of the sacred college. But as the concurrence of two

thirds of the votes had been made necessary, the elee'tion was often

delayed by. the private interest and paffions of the cardinals; and
