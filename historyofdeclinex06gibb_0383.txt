OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

relate the story of the true Mtgstaphffl or of an Impostor, who per-
sonated that lost prince. He fought by his father’s fide in the battle

of Angor-a: but when the captive sultan was permitted to enquire for
his children, Mousa alone could be found; and the Turkish histo-
rians, the ssaves of the triumphant faotion, are persuaded that his
brother was confounded among the ssain. If Mustapha escaped from
that disastrous field, he was concealed twelve years from his friends
and enemies ; till he emerged in Thessaly, and was hailed by a nu-
merous party, as the son and success'or of Bajazet. His first defeat
would have been his last, had not the true, or false, Mustapha

been saved by the Greeks, and restored, after the decease of his bro-⁶
ther Mahomet‚ to liberty aud empire. A degenerate mind seemed
to argue his spurious birth 3 and if, on the throne of Adrianople, he
was adored as the Ottoman sultan3 his ssight, his fetters, and an ig-
nominious gibbet, delivered the impostor to popular contempt. A
fimilar charaeter and claim was asserted by several rival pretenders ς
thirty persons are said to have suffered under the name of Mustapha;
and these frequent executions may perhaps insinuate, that the Turkish
court was not perfeffly secure of the death of the lawful prince.
2. After his father's captivity, Isa⁷³ reigned for some time in the

neighbourhood of Angora, Sinope, and the Black Sea3 and his am-
baffadors were dismiffed from the presence of Timour with fair pro-
mises and honourable gifts. Eut their master was soon deprived of
his province and life, by ajeaious brother, the sovereign of Amasia3
and the final event suggested a pious ammon, that the law of Moses
aud Jesus, of fflz and Mozffiz, had been abrogated by the greater
Mahomet. “ 3. Solimon is not nurnbered in the list of the Turkissi
