1210-1214.

The arms of Zingis and his lieutenants succeffively reduced the
hords of the desert, who pitched their tents between the wall of
China and the Volga3 and the Mogul emperor became the mo-
narch of the pastoral world, the lord of many millions of shepherds
and soldiers‚ who felt their united strength, and were impatient to
rush on the mild and wealthy climates of the south. His ancestors
had been the tributaries of the Chinese emperors; and Temugin
himself had been disgraced by a title of honour and servitude. The
court of Pekin was astonished by an embaffy from its former vassal,
who, in the tone of the king of nafions, exac‘Jted the tribute and
obedienee which he had paid‚ and who affeeted to treat the βυτ qf'
heaven as the most contemptible of mankind. An haughty answer‘
disguised their secret apprehensione 3 and their fears were soon justi-
fied by the march of innumerable squadrons, who piercedon all

general historian (pars ii. c. 74. p. 1·50.), in
the {³² volume os the Scriptores Rerum Hun-

the origInal narrative of a contemporary, an

¹⁷ Matthew Paris has represented, from
anthentic docnmenm, the danger and distress
of Europe (consult the word Tartari in his
copious Index). From motives of zeal and
curiosity, the court of the great Khan, in the
xiilffi century, was visited by two friars,

,John de Plano carpini, and William Ru-
bruquis, and by Marco Polo, a Venetian
gentleman. The Latin relations of the two
former are inserted in the {⁵1 volume of Hack—
luyt; the Italian original or version of the>
third (Fabric. Bibliot. Latin. medii AEvi,
tom. ii. p. 198. tom.v. p. ες.) may be found
in the ii⁶ tome of Ramufio.

’Β In his great History of the Huns, M. de
Guignes has most amply treated of Zingis
Khan and his success'orS. See torn. iii. l. xv

Seljukians of Reum, tom. ii. l. xi. the Cariz-
mians, l. xiv. and the Mamalulzes, tom. iv.

volume. He is ever learned and accurate3
yet 1 arn only indebted to him for a general
view, and some passages of A'oulfeda, which
are still latent in the Arabae text.
