oath, that, in this wretched condition, they should offer themselves
as a lcffon to the head of the chureh. Hope or sear, laffitude or
remorse‚ the charaeters of the men, and the circumstances of the
times, might sometimes obtain an interval of peace and obedienee;

and the pope was restored with joyful acclamations to the Lateran
or vatican, from whence he had been ⁴driven with threats and vio-

lence. But the root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a

momentary calm was preceded and followed by such tempests as
had almost sunk the bark of St. Peter. Rome continually presented
the aspect of war and discord : the churcbes and palaces were forti-
fied and affaulted by the factione and families3 and, after giving
peace to Europe, Calistus the second alone had resolution and power
to prohibit the use of pri-vate arms in the metropolis. Among the
nations who revered the apostolic throne, the tumults of Rome pro-
voked a general indignatiou; and, in ¹a letter to his disciple Euge-
nius the third, St. Bernard, with the sharpness of his wit and zeal,
has stigmatised the vices of the rebellious people ¹⁶. “ Who is ig-
“ norant,'’ says the monk of Clairvaux, “ of the vanity and arrogance
“ of the Romans? a nation nursed in sedition, cruel, untrae‘table‚
“ and scorning to obey, unless they are too feeble to refist. When
“ they promise to serve, they aspir-e to reign3 if they svvear alle-

“ ghmce, they watch the opportunity os revolt 3 yet they ‘vent their
‘⁶ discontent in loud clamours if your doors, or your counsels, are
“ shut against them. Dextrous in mischief, they have never learnt
“ the scienee of doing good. Odious to earth and heaven, impious
“ to God, seditious among themselves, jealous of their neighbours‚
“ inhumati to strangers, they love no one, by no one are they be-
“ loved5 and while they wish to inspire fear, they live in base and
‘⁶ continual apprehension. They will not submit ; they know how

et cervicositas Romanorum? Gens insueta p.441.). The saint takes breath, and then
