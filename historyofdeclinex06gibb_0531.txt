who, on a similar summons, had yielded a fortified city with four zond,

hundred cannon and ten or twelve thousand soldiers. The capitu·
lation·of Trebizond was faithfully performed3 and the emperor,
with his family, was transported to a castle in Romania: but on a
ssight suspicion of corresponding with the Perfian king, David, and
the whole Comnenian race, were sacrificed to the jealousy or avariee
of the conqueror. Nor could the name of father long protest the
unfortunate Demetrius from exile and confiscation3 his abje& sub-
mission moved the pity and contempt of the sultan; his followers
were transplanted to Constantinople ; and his poverty was alleviated
by a penfion of fifty thousand aspers, till a monastic habit and a
tardy death released Palaeologus from an earthly master. It is not
easy to pronounce whether the servitude of Demetrius, or the exile
of his brother Thomas ⁹⁰, be the rnost inglorious. On the conquest
of the Morea, the despot escaped to Corfu, and from thence to
Italy, with some naked adherents: his name, his sufferings, and the
head of the apostle St. Andrew, entitled him to the hospitality‘of the
Vatican3 and his misery was prolonged by a penfion of fix thou-
sand ducats from the pope and cardinals. His two sons, Andrew
and Manuel‚ were edueated in Italy3 but the eldest, contemptible to
his enemies and burthensorne to his friends, was degraded by the
baseness of his life and marriage. A title was his sole inheritance3
and that inheritance he succeffively sold to the kings of France and
