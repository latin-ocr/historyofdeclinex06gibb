rity is still invested with the Imperial title3 and the admiration of his
subjeets, who revered him almost as a deity, may be justified in some
degree by the praise or confession of his bitterest enemies⁶⁵. Al-
though he was lame of an hand and foot‚ his form and stature were
not unworthy of his rank3 and his vigorous heahh, so effential to
