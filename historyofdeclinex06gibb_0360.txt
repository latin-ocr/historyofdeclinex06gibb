THE DECLINE AND FALL

It was on the banks of the ‘Ganges that Timour was informed,
by his speedy meffengers, of the disturbances which had arisen' on
the confines of Georgia and Anatolia‚ of the revolt of the Chris-
tians, and the ambitious designs ‚of the sultan Bajazet. His vigour
of mind and body was not impaired by fixtymthree years, and in·
numerable fatigues; and, after enjoying some tranquil months in the
palace of Samarcand, he proclaimed a new expedition of seven years
into the western countries of Asia ²⁷. To the soldiers who had served
in the Indian war, he granted the choice of remaining at horne or

Christians of Georgia, who were strong only in their rocks, their
castles, and the winter season ; but these obstacles were overcome by
the zeal and perseverance of Timour: the rebels submitted to the
tribute or the Koran ; and if both religions boasted of theIr martyrs,
that name is more justly due to the Christian prisoners, who were
‚offered the choice of abjuration or death. On his descent from
the hills, the emperor gave audience to the first ambaffadors of Ba-
jazet, and opened the hostile correspondence of complaints and me-
naces3 which fermented two years before the final explofion. Be->

will seldom be wanting. The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now
touched each other in the neighbourhood of Erzerum, and the
Euphrates 3 nor had the doubtful limit been ascertained by time and
‚treaty. Each of these ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of
violating his territory ς of threatening his vaffals3 and proteffing his
rebels3 and, by the name of rebels, each understood the fugitive
princes, whose kingdoms he had usurped, and whose life or liberty
lie implacably pursued. The resemblance of character was still more
