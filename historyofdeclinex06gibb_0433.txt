But a purer idiom was spoken in the court

and taught in the college3 and the flourishing state of the language

is described, and perhaps embellished‚ by a learned Italian⁷⁹, who, by

a long residence and noble marriage ⁸⁰, was naturalized at Constan-

tinople about thirty years before the Turkish conquest.

“ The vul-

“ and infedled by the multitude of strangers and mercham, who*
“ every day flock to the city and mingle with the inhabitants. It

3600 Graeco-barbarous words, to which, in
a second edition, he subjoined 1800 more3

p. 691—751.) and Tiraboschi (Istoria della
Letteraturaltaliana‚ tom.yii. p.282—z94.),
