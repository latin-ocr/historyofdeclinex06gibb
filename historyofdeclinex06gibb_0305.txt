of Genoa, if the ambition of the republic had not been checked by

the ruin of her freedom and naval power. A long contest of one
hundred and thirty years was determined by the triumph of Venice;

and the factions of the Genoese compelled them to feel< for do-
mestic peace under the protenion of a foreign lord, the duke of
Milan, or the French king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived

that of conquest 3 and the colony of Pera still awed the capital and
navigated the Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final

servitude of Constantinople itself.
