u--w—-J tercourse of epistles and embaffies, which rose and fell with the
events of war, was maintained between the throne of Cairo and the
-camp of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the result of igno:
rance and enthusiasm, The ministers of Egypt declared in an
haughty, or infinuated in a milder, tone, that their sovereign, the
true and lawful commander of the faithful, had rescued Jerusalem
from the Turkish yoke 3 and that the pilgrims‚ if they would divide
their numbers, and lay afide their arms, 1hould find a safe and
hospitable reception at the sepulchre of Jesus. In the belief of their
lost condition, the caliph Mostali despised their arms and impri—
soned their deputies : the conquest and vi&ory of Antioch prompted
him to solicit those formidable champions with gifts of horses and
filk robes, of vases, and purses of gold and sllver3 and in his estimate
of their merit or power, the first place was affigned to Bohemond,
and the second to Godfrey. In either fortune, the answer of the
crusaders was firm and uniform: they disdained to enquire into the
private claims or poffeffioris of the followers of Mahomet: what-
soever was his name or nation, the usurper of Jerusalem was their
enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and ternis of their pil-
grimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city and province,
their sacred right, that he could deserve theIr alliance, or deprecate
their impending and irresistible attack ¹⁰³.

consternation, they hastily dispersed to enjoy the luxury, of Syria.
The causes of this strange delay may be found in the want of strength
