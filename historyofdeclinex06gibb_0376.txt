fign of subduing Egypt and Africa, marching from the Nile to the
Atlantic Ocean, entering Europe by the Streights of Gibraltar, and,
after impofing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of re-
turning home by the deserts of Ruffia and Tartary. This remote,
and perhaps imaginary, danger was averted by the submiffion of
the sultan of Egypt: the honours of the prayer and the coin, at-
tested at Cairo the supremacy of Timour-3 and a rare gift of a
glrcffl, or camelopard‚ and nine ostriches‚ represented at Samarcand
the tribute of the African world. Our imagination is not less asto-
nished by the portrait of a Mogul‚ who, in his camp before Smyrna,
meditates and almost accomplishes the invaslon of the Chinese
empire ⁶¹. Timour was urged to this enterprise by national honour
and religious zeal. The torrents which he had shed of Musulman
blood could be expiated only by an equal destruAEtion of the in-

fidels ; and as he now stood at the gates of paradise, he might best
secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the idols of China,
founding moschs in every city, and establissiing the profeffion of saith
in one God, and his prophet Mahomet. The recent expulfion of the
house of Zingis was an insult on the Mogul name; and the disorders of
the empire afforded the fairest opportunity for revenge. The illustrious
Hongvou, founder of the dynasty of Ming, died four years before
the battle of Angora 3 and his grandson, a weak and unfortunate
youth, was burnt in his palace, after a million of Chinese had
perished in the civil war ⁶². Before he evacuated Anatolia, Timour
dispatched beyond the Sihoon a numerous army, or rather colony,
of his old and new subjects, to open the road, to subdue the Pagan
Calmucks and Mungals, and to found cities and magazines in the
