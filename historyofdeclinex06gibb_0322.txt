be involved in the universal destruction, unless he vifited in person,
and as a suppliant, the royal hord. The emperor Frederie the second
embraced a more generous mode of defence ; and his letters to the
kings of France and England, and the princes of Germany, repre-
sented the common danger, and urged them to arm their vaffals in
this just and rational crusade ²⁹. The Tartars themselves were awed
by the fame and valour of the Franks: the town of Newstadt in
Austria was bravely defended against them by fifty knights and
twenty cross—bows3 and they raised the fiege on the appearance of a
German army. After wasting the adjacent kingdoms of Servia,
Bosnia‚ and Bulgaria, Batou ssowly retreated from the Danube to
the Volga to enjoy the rewards of viCtory in the city and palace
of Serai, which started at his command from the midst of the
desert.

IV. Even the poor and frozen regions of the North attraffited the
arms of the Moguls: Sheibani Khan, the brother of the great Batou,
led an hord of fifteen thousand families into the wilds of Siberia;
and his descendants reigned at Tobolsszoy above three centuries, till
the Russian conquest. The spirit of enterprise which pursued the
course of the Oby and Yenisei must have led to the discovery of the
icy sea. After brushing away the monstrous fabIes, of men with
dogs heads and cloven feet, we shall find, that, fifteen years after
the death of Zingis, the Moguls were informed of the name and
manners of the Sarnoyedes in the neighbourhood of the polar circle,
