Mahometan kings. The fiege, more especially of the castle, might a...-„—.a
have been a work of time3 but he tempted, by the appearance of
weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizir to descend into the
plain, with ten thousand cuiraffiers, forty thousand of his foot-gnards,
and one hundred and twenty elephante„ whose tusks are said to have
been armed with sharp and poisoned daggers. Against these mon-
sters, or rather against the imagination of his troops, he conde-
scended to use some extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch,
of iron spikes and a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the
Moguls to smile at their own fears ; and, as soon as these unwieldy
animals were routed‚ the inferior species (the men of India) dis-

Coupele, the statue of the cow, that stems to discharge thejmighty
river, whose source is far distant among the mountains of Thibet ²⁶.
His return was along the skirts os the northern hills ; nor could this
rapid campaign of one year justify the strange forefight of hie emirs,

that their children in a warm climate would degenerate into a race
of Hindoos.
