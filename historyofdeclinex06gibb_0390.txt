Hereditary
succeffion and
merit of the
Ottomans.

THE DECLINE AND FALL·

In the establishment and restoration of the Turkiffi empire, the
first merit must doubtless be afligned to the personal qualities of the
sultans; since, in human life, the most important scenes will depend
on the character of a single actor. By some shades of wisdom and
virtue, they may be discriminated from each other3aebut, except in
a single instance, a period of nine reigns, and two hundred and
sixty-sive years, is occupied, from the elevation of Othman to the
death of Soliman, by a rare series of warlike and active princes,
who impreffed their subjects with obedience and their enemies with
terror. Instead of the ssothful luxury of the serag1i0‚ the heirs of
royalty were educated in the council and the field : from early youth
they were entrusted by their fathers with the command of provinces
and armies3 and this manly institution, which was often productive
of civil war, must have essentially contributed to the discipline and'
vigour of the monarchy. The Ottomans cannot style themselves,
like the Arabian caliphs, the descendants or success'ors of the apostle
of God; and the kindred which they claim with the Tartar khans
of the house of Zingis, appears to be founded in flattery rather
than in truth⁸⁵· Their origin is obscure; but their sacred and in-
defeaslble right, which no time can erase and no violence can in-
fringe, was soon and unalterably implanted in the minds of their

but his inheritance devolves to an infant or an ideot: nor has the
most daring rebel presumed to ascend the throne of his lawful so·-
vereign⁵⁶. While the transient dynasties of Asia have been con-
tinually subverted by a crafty vizir in the palace or a vietorious
general in the camp, the Ottoman succeffion has been confirmed by ⁷
