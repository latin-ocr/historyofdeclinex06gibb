h-——v—-1 aspired to 0011οἃ 1110 remnant of the Greeks3 and they returned in

crowds, as soon as they were affured of their lives, their liberties,
and the free exercil‘e of their religion. In the 010611011 and investi-
ture of a patriarch, the ceremonial of the Byzantine court was re-
vived and imitated. With a mixture of satisfaCtion and horror, they
beheld the sultan >on his thr0ne3 who delivered into the hands of
Gennadius the crosier or pastoral staff, the symbol of his ecclesiastic-‚al
office ; who 0011111161οἀ 1110 patriarch to the gate of the seraglio‚ pre-
sented him with an horse richly capaiisoned, and (111061οἀ 1110 vizirs
and bashaws to lead him to the palace which had been allotted for
his refidence Εἴ

tween the two religions: their lirnits were marked3 and, till it was

The churches of Constantinople were ffiared be-

infringed by Selim the grandson of Mahomet‚ the Greeks ⁸³ enjoyed
above fixty years the benefit of this equal partition. Encouraged by
the ministers of the divan, who wished to elude the fanaticism of the
sultan, the Christian advocates presumed to allege that this division
had been an adr, not of generoslty, but ofjustice3 not a conceffion,
but a compa&; and that if one half of the city had been taken by
storm, the other moiety had surrendered on the saith of a sacred
capitulation. The original grant had indeed been consumed by fire:
but the loss was supplied by the testimony of three aged Janizaries
who remembered the transadiion ; and their venal oaths are of
more weight 111 1110 opinion of Cantemir‚ than the pofitive and un-

animous consent of the history of the times ⁸⁴.
The γ

¹³² Phranza (l. iii. c. 19.) relates the cere-
mouy, which has posfibly been adorned in
the Greek reports to each other, and to the
Latius. The fact is confirmed by Emanuel
Malaxus, who wrote, in vulgar Greek, the
History of :he Patriarchs aster the ‹aking of
Constantinople, inserted in the Tur-coGraecia
of Crusius (Lv. p.106—184.). But the
most patient reader will not believe that Ma·
homer adopted the Catholic form, ‘¹ Sanfia
Μ Trinitas quat mihi donavit imperium te in
⁶¹ patriarcham novat Romae deligit.’'

⁸³ From the Turco-Graecia of Crustas, διε.
Spondanus(A.D.145·3‚N⁰zr. 1438,N016.)
describes the slavery and domestic quarrels
of the Grcek church. The patriarch who
succeeded Gennadius, threw himself in de·

spair into a well.
⁸* Cantemir (p. 101-105'.) infists on the
unanimous consentes the Turkifh historiatas,
ancient as wellas modern, and argues, that
they would not have violated the truth to
diminish their national glory‚ fince it is
esteemed more honourable to take a. city by
force
