and the example of Lucca, which contained three hundred towers;
her law, which confined their height to the measure of fourscore

and populous states. The first step of the senator Brancaleone in the
establishrnent of peace and justice, was to demolish (as we have al-
ready seen) one hundred and forty of the towers of Rome5 and, in
the last days of anarchy and discord, as late as the reign of Martia
the fifth, forty·four still stood in one of the thirteen or fourteen
regions of the city. ‘To this mischievous purpose, the remains of
