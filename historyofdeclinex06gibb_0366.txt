mark the charaCter of the Mogul her03 but Ι shall 'briefly mention ³⁰,
that he ereeted on the ruins of Bagdad a pyramid of ninety thousand
heads; again visited Georgia3 eneainped on the banks of Araxes;
and proclaimed his resolution of marching against the Ottoman ern-
Peror. Conscious of the importance of the war, he collected hig
forces from every province : eight hundred thousand men were en-
rolled on his military list ³⁷ 3 but the splendid cornmands of five, and
ten, thousand horse, may be rather expressive of the rank and pen-

fion of the chiefs, than of the genuine number of effective soldiers ³³.

In the pillage of Syria, the Moguls had acquired immense riches: but ⁷*

the delivery of their pay and arrears for seven years, more firmly
attached them to the Imperial standard.

During this diversmn of the Mogul arms, Bajazet had two years*

were of an unequal complexion. We may discriminate the JanizarIes
who have been gradually raised to an establissiment of forty thousand
men3 a national cavalry, the Spahis of modern times ς twenty thou-

the troops of Anatolia‚ whose princes had taken refuge in the camp
of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom he had driven frorn

³⁶ The marches and occupations of Ti-
mour between the Syrian and Ottoman wars,
are represented by Sherefeddin (1.v. c. 29
——43.) and Arabshah (tom. ii. c. 15-18,).

³⁷ This number of 800,000 was extrafted
by Arabshah, or rather by Ebn Schounah‚
ex rationario Timuri, on the saith of a Cariz-
mian officer (torn. i. c. 63. p. 617.); and it
is remarkable enough, that a Greek historian
(Phranza, l.. i. c. ²9·) adds no more than
20‚000 men. Poggius reckons 1,000‚000;
another Latin contemporary (Chron. Tarvi-
iianum, apud Muratori‚ tom. xix. p. 800.)
1,100‚000; and theenormous fumosi ,600‚000
is attested by a German soldier, who was
present at the battle of Angora (Leunclav.

ad Chalcondyl. l. iii. p. 82.). Timour, in
his Institutions‚ hasmot deigned to1ca1culate
his troops, his subjeets, or his revenues.

³⁸ A wide latitude of non effeetives was
allowed by the Great Mognl for his own
pride and the benefit of his officers. Ber-
nier's patron was penge-Hand, commander
of 5000 horse; of which he maintained no
more than 500(Voyage5‚ tom. i. p. 288‚289.).

³⁹ Timour himself fixes at 4:0,000 rnen
the Ottoman army (Institutions, p. ¹530*
which is reduced to 15o,000'by Phi-anza
(hi. c. 29.), and swelled by the ‘German
soldier to 1,400,000. lt is evident, that the
Moguls were the more numerous.
