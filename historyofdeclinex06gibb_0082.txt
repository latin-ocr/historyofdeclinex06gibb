the borders of Egypt was poffeffed by the Christian pilgrims. If
the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy, the counts of Edessa
and Tripoli owned themselves the vafl'als of the king of Jerusalem:
the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrate33 and the four cities of
Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relies of
the Mahometan conquests in Syria¹²². The lawa and language, the
manners and titles, of the French nation and Latin church, were in-

tribes of Levi and Benjamin, gave David an
army of 1‚300,000, or 1,574,ooo fighting

rarius (de Aequisnione Terrae Sanctae, c. 89
—98- p073z—740.). Some domestic faecs
are celebrated in the Chronicles of Pisa,
Genoa, and Venice, in the wth, jath, and
,dim tomes of Muratori.
