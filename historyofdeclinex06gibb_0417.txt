OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

but the bold and vigorous proceedings of the council of Bas11³⁹ had
almost been fatal to the reigning pontiff, Eugenius the fourth. A
just suspicion of his defign prompted the fathers to hasten the pro-
mulgation of their first decree, that the representatives of the church-
militant on earth were invested with a divine and spiritual juris-
diffion over all Christians‚ without excepting the pope; and that a
general council could not be diffolved, prorogued, or transferred,
