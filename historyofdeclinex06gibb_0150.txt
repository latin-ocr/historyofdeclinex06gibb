for ever deserted the cause of the Greeks3 and the conflagration
spread from the banks of the Danube to the hills of Macedonia and
Thrace. After some faint efforts, Isaac Angelus and his brother
acquiesced in their independence3 and the Imperial troops were soon
discouraged by the bones of their fellow-soldiers‚ that were scattered

and humbly received from the pope, the licence of coining money,
the royal title, and a Latin archbilhop or patriarch. ,. The Vatican
exulted in the spiritual conquest of Bulgaria, the first object of the
schism 3 and if the Greeks could have preserved the prerogatives of
the church, they would gladly have resigned the rights of the mo-
