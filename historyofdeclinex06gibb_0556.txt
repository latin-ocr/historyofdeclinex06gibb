THE DECLINE AND FALL

rebellion‚ they consented without relu&ance to the restoration of the
praefetf't. About fifty years after this event, Innocent the third, the
most ambitione, or at least the most fortunate, of the ponfiffs, deli-
vered the Romans and himself from this badge of foreign dominion:
he invested the praefe& with a banner instead of a svvord, and ab·-
solved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the German
emperors ⁴². In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or future car«
dinal, was named by the pope to the civil government of Rome ;-
but his jurisdiction has been reduced to a narrovv compass3 and in
the days of freedom, the right or exercise was derived from the se-
nate and people. IV. After the revival of the senate ⁴³, the con-
script fathers (if I may use the expression) vvere invested with the
legissative and executive power 3 but their views seldom reached be-
yond the present day3 and that day was most frequently disturbed

by violence and tumult. In its utmost plenitude, the order or affem-
bly confisted of fifty-fix senators ⁴⁴, the most eminent of whom
were distinguissied by the title of counsellors; they vvere nominated,
perhaps annually, by the people; and a previous choice of their
elefiors‚ ten persons in each region or parish, might afford a bafis for
a free and permanent constitution. The popes, who in this tempest.
submitted rather to bend than to break, confirmed by treaty the
establishment and privileges of the senate, and expe&ed from time,
peace, and religion, the restoration of their government. The mo-
tives of public and private interest might sometimes draw from the
Romans an occafional and temporary sacrifice of their claims ; and

they renevved their oath of allegiance to the successor of St. Peter

praefectura eum publice investivit, qui usque
ad id tempus juramento fidelitatis imperatori
fuit obligatus et ab eo praefefturae tenuit ho-

tom. iii. P.i. p. 487.).
