THE DECLINE AND' FALL

records. With the first rays of light⁷¹, we discern the nobility and·
opulence of Atho, a French knight: his nobility, in the rank and'-
title of a nameless father 3 his opnlence, in the foundation of the*
castle of Courtenay in the distri& of Gatinois, about fifty-fix miles
to the south of Paris. From the reign of Robert‚ the son of Hugh
Capet‚ the barons of Courtenay are conspicuous among the imme-
diate vaffals of the crown3 and Joscelin‚ the grandson of Atho andra
noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the first crusade. A

standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second count of Edessa: a
princely fies, which he was worthy to receive, and able to maintain,

parture of his cousin, Joscelin himself was invested with the county
of Edessa on both sides of the Euphrates. By the oeconomy in.

and filver, with arms and horse-s. In a holy warfare of thirty years„
he was alternately a conqueror and a captive3 but he died like a
soldier, in an horse-litter at the head of his troops; and his last
glance beheld the flight of the Turkish invaders who had presumed
on his age and infirmities. His son and successor, of the same
name, was less deficient in valour than in vigilanee3 but he some--
times forgot that dominion is acquired and maintained by the same
arts. He challenged the hostility of the Turks, without securing
the friendship of the prince of Antioch3 and, amidst the peaceful
luxury of Turbefl'el, in Syria ⁷², Joscelin neglected the defence of
the Christian frontier beyond the Euphrates. In his absence, Zenghi,.
the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his capital, Edessa„
which was feebly defended by a timorous and dissoyal crowd ofi
