OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

In the choice of the attack‚ the Fre rel] and Venetians were di—
vided by their habits of life and warfare. The former affirmml with
truth, that Constantinople was most acccffible on the fide of the sca
and the hai-bour. The latter might affert with honour, that they
had long enough trusted their lives and foi-tunes to a frail bark and
a precarious element, and loudly demanded a trial of knighthood, a
firm ground, and a close onsct‚ either on foot or horseback. After

a prudent compromise, of employing the two nations by sea and

the army, theyrboth proceeded from the entrance to the extremity
