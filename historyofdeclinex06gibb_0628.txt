THE DECLxNE AND FALL

majority was decided by a secret ballot 3 and their deerees were pro-
mulgated in the venerable name of the Roman senate and people.
It would not be easy to aflign a period in which this theory of go-
vernment has been reduced to accurate and constant praffice, fince

the establishment of order has been gradually connet‘sted with the
decay of liberty. Butrin the year one thousand five hundred and
eighty, the ancient statutes were collected, methodised in three
books, and adapted to present use, under the pontificate‚ and with
the approbation‚ of Gregory the thirteenth ⁸³ z this civil and criminal
code is the modern law of the city3 and, if the popular affemblies
have been abolished, a foreign senator, with the three conservators,
still resldes in the palaee of the Capitol ⁸⁴. The poliey of the Caesars
has been repeated by the popes5 and the bishop of Rome affected
to maintain the form of a repubfic, While he reigned with the ab-
solute powers of a tempor-al, as well as spiritual, monarch.

It is an obvious truth, that the times must be suited to extraordi-
nary emmonem, and that the genius of Cromwell 01· Retz might
now expire in obscurity. The politica] enthusiasm of Rienzi had
exalted him to a throne 3 the same enthusiasm, in the next century,
conducted his imitator to the gallows. The birth of Stephen Por-
caro was noble, his reputation spotless 3 his tongue was armed with
eloquence, his mind was enlightened with learning; and he aspired,
beyond the aim of vulgar ambitiosi, to free his country and immor-
talise his name. The dominion of priests is most odious to a liberal
spirit : every scruple was removed by the recent knowledge of the
fable and forgery of Constantine's donation ; Petrarch was now the
oracle of the Italians; and as often as Porcaro revolved the ode
