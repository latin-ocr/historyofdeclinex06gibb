THE DECLINE AND FALL

prince of the Alemanni3 and the vain and feeble Angelus affected

to be ignorant of the name of one of the greatest men and monarchs
of the age. While they viewed with hatred and suspicion the
Latin pilgrims, the Greek emperors maintained a ἢῑὶᾶ, though se·-
eret, alliance with the Turks and Saracens. Isaac Angelus com-
plained, that by his friendship for the great Saladin he had incurred

Anatolia by famine, pestilence‚ and the Turkish arrows: and the

subduing Perfia and Chorasan in their way to Jerusalem; of their
humanity from the maffacre of the Christian people, a friendly city,
who came out to meet them with palms and croffes in their hands.
The arms of Conrad and Louis were less cruel and imprudent ; but

the Latin princes. Instead of crulhing the common foe, by a double
attack at the same time but on different fides, the Germans were
urged by emulation, and the Freneh were retarded by jealousy. Louis
had scarcely paffed the Bosphorus when he was met by the returning
emperor, who had lost the greatest part of his army in glorious,
but unsuccessful, affion on the banks of the Maeander. The con-
trast of the pomp of his rival hastened the retreat of Conrad: the
desertion of his independent vaffals reduced him to his hereditary
troops3 and he bon-owed some Greek veffels to execute by sea the
pilgrimage of Palestine. Without studying the leffons of experience,
