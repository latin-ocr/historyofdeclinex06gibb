mountains and the Adriatic sea. Unable to contend with the
sultan's power, Casti-iot submitted to the hard conditions of peace
and tribute: he delivered his four sons as the pledges of his fidelity;
and the Christian youths, after receiving the mark of circumcision,
were instrueted in the Mahornetan religion, and trained in the arms

of his vanity. His afflons are celebrated in
the Epitome Rerum Hungaricarum (p. 32²

wife and facetious sayings are regissered by

marked by Marinus with brevity and reluc-
mnce (l. i. p. 6, 7.).
