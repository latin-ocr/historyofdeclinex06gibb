Genoese and Pisan vessels, that were attrac‘ted by religion or trade to·
the coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the return precarious, and
the communication difficult and dangerous. Indolence or weakness
had prevented the Franks from investing the entire circuit 3 and the
perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the Wants and recruited the
garrison of the city. At the end of seven months, after the ruin of
their cavalry, and an enormous loss by famine, desertion‚ and fatigue‚

speedily encompaffed and besieged by the innumerable forces of Ker-
