478 THE DECLINE AND FALL

CLQVffi-P· the avarice of the rich denied the emperor, and reserved for the

s--v--a Turks, the secret treasures which might have raised in their defenee
whole armies of mercenariesw. The indigent and solitary prince
prepared however to sustain his formidable adversary3 but if his
courage were equal to the peril, his strength was inadequate to the
contest. In the beginning of the spring, the Turkish vanguard
swept the towns and villages as far as the gates of Constantinople:
submiffion was spared and proteC’ced3 whatever presumed to refist
was exterminated with fire and sword. The Greek places on the
Black Sea, Mesembria, Acheloum, and Bizon, surrendered on the·
first summons; Selybria alone deserved the honours of a siege or
blockade; and the bold inhabitants, while they were invested by
land, launched their boats, pillaged the opposite coast of Cyzicus,
and sold their captives in the public market. But on the approach
of Mahomet himself all was silent ⁴and prostrate: he first halted at
the distance of five miles; and from thence advancing in battle
array, planted before the gate of St. Romanus the Imperial standard;
and, on the fixth day of April, formed the memorable fiege of Con-
stantinople.

Forcesofthe The troops of Asia and Europe extended on the right and left

'Turks5 from the Propontis to the ,harbourz the Janizaries in the front were
stationed before the sultan's tent; the Ottoman line was covered by
a deep intrenchment 3 and a subordinate army inclosed the suburb of
Galata, and watched the doubtful saith of the Genoese. The inqui-
sitive Philelphus, who refided in Greece about thirty years before
the siege, is confident, that all the Turkish forees, of any name or
value, could not exceed the number of sixty thousand horse and
twenty thousand foot; and he upbraids the pusillanimity of the

nations, who had tamely yielded to an handful of Barbarians.
