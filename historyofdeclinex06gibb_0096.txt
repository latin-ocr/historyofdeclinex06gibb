third crusades were undertakeu under the reign of Manuel Com-

impetuous, and often malevolent3 and the naturai union of a
cowardly and a mischievous temper was excmplified in the latter, ,

Frederic's army was furnished with three marks of filver to defray

the mixture of chalk, or other poisonous ingredients‚ in the bread ς
and should Manuel be acquitted of any foul connivance, he is guilty
of coining base money for the purpose of trading with the pilgrims.
