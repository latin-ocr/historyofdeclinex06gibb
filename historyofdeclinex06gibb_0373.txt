OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

composed at Damascus the florid and malevolent history of Timour,
for which hc had collc&cd materials in his journies over Turkey and
Tartary ⁵⁴. without any poffible correspondence between the Latin
and the Arabiam writer, they agree in the fa& of the iron cage3
and their agreement is a striking proof of their common veracity,
Ahmed Arabshah likewise rel-ates another outrage, which Bajazet cn-
dured, of a more domestic and tender nature. His indiscreet men-
tion of women and divorces was deeply resented by the jealous
Tartar: in the feast of victory, the wine was served by female cup-
bearers, and the sultan beheld his own concubines and wives con-
founded among the ssaves, and exposed without a veil to the eyes of
intemperance. To escape a fimilar indignity, it is said, that his suc-
ceffors, except in a fingle instance, have abstained from legitimate
nuptials; and the Ottoman praefice and belief, at least in the fix-
teenth century, is attested by the observing Busbequius⁵⁵, ambaffador
from the court of Vienna to the great Soliman. 4. Such is the
separation of language‚ that the testimony of a Greek is not less
independent than that of a Latin or an Arab. I suppress the names
of Chalcondyles and Ducas, who flourished in a later period, and who
speak ‘in a less positive tone3 but more attention is due to George
Phranza ⁵⁶, protovestiare of the last emperors, and who was born a
year before the battle of Angora. Twenty-two years after that
event, he was sent ambaffador to Amurath the second3 and the
historian might converse with some veteran‘ Janizaries, who had been
made prisoners with the sultan, and had themselves seen him in his
iron cage. 5. The last evidence, in every sense, is that of the Turkish
annals, which have been consulted or transcribed by Leunclavius,
