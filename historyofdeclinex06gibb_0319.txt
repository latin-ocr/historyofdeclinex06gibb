cities of Mecca and Medina²⁶ were prote6‘oed by the Arabian desert3
but the Moguls spread beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, pillaged
Aleppo and Damascus, and threatened to join the Franks in the de-
liverance ofJerusalem. Egypt was lost, had she been defended only
by her feeble offspring: but the Mamalukes had breathed in their
infancy the keenness of a Scythian air: equal in valour, superior in
discipline, they met the Moguls in many a well-fought field3 and
drove back the stream of hostility to the eastward of thev Euphrates.
But it overflowed with refistless violence the kingdoms of Armenia

and Anatolia‚ of which the former was poffeffed by the Christians, 12 z

refistance to the Mogul arms, till Azzadin fought a refuge among
the Greeks of Constantinople, and his feeble succeffors, the last of
the Seljukiah dynasty, were finally extirpated by the khans of

Perfia.

squadrons, that in less than six years they had measured a line of ninety

degrees of longitude, a fourth part of the circumference of the globe.
The great rivers of Afia and Europe, the Volga and Kama, the Don

their horses, or paffed on the ice, or traversed in leathern boats,
which followed the camp, and transported their waggons and artil-
