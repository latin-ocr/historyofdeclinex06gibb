Latin church the right and praefice of appeals⁷; and, from the
north and west, the bishops and abbots were invited or summoned
to solicit, to complain, to accuse, or to justify, before the threshold
of the apostles. A rare prodigy is once recorded, that two horses,¹
belonging to the archbilhops of Mentz and Cologne, repaffed the
Alps, yet laden with gold and filver ⁸: but it was soon understood,
that the success, both of the pilgrims and clients, depended much less

on the justice of their cause than on the value of their offering. The
wealth and piety of these strangers were ostentatioussy displayed ; and
their expences, sacred or profane, circulated in various channels for
the emolument of the Romans.

Such powerful motives should have firmly attached the voluntary Inconstaney

and pious obedience of the Roman people to their spiritual and tem- pizgppersts-
