440 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Q escape from the hands of a fierce and fanatic people ⁹. The Ruffians
refused a paffage to the miffionaries of Rome who aspired to convert
the Pagans beyond the Tanais⁹; and their refusal was justified by
the maxim, that the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than that of
schism. The errors of the Bohemians were excused by their ab·
horrence for the pope ; and a deputation of the Greek clergy soli-
cited the friendihip of those sanguinary enthufiasts ¹⁰. While Eugenius
triumphed in the union and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party
was conti-aeted to the walls, or rather to the palace‚ of Constanti-
nople. The zeal of Palaeologus had been excited by interest ; it was
soon cooled by oppofition : an attempt to violate the national belief
might endanger his life and crown; nor could the pious rebels be>
destitute of foreign and domestic aid. The sword of his brother
Demetrius, who in Italy had maintained a prudent and popular
silence, was half unffieathed in the cause of relig10n3 and Amurath,.
the Turkilh sultan, was displeased and alarmed by the seeming friend-›-

de Ruffie, tom. ii. p. 242—247.) is extraCted
from the patriarcha! archives. The scenes
of Ferrara and Florence are described by
ignorance and paffion; but the Ruffians are

eredible in the account of their own preju-
dices.

⁹ The Shamanism, the ancient religion of

the Samanaeans and Gymnosopffists, has been
driven by the more popular Bramins from
India'into the northern deserts; the naked
philosophers were compelled to wrap them-
selves in ἕως but they insenfibly sunl< into
wiurds and phyficians. The Moser-ans and

Tcheremiffes in the European Ruffia adhere
to this religion, which is formed on the earth-
ly model of one king or God. his ministers
or angels, and the rebellious spirits who op-
pose his government. As these tribes of the⁴
Volga have no images, they might more

justly retort on the Latin miffionaries the name
