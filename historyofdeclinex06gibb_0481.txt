OF;,THE ROMAN E‘MPIRE.¹ 463

“ whom Ι can neither love nor trust, nor esteem. You are nota C H Α Ρ“
“ stranger to Lucas Notaras, the great admiral3 obstinately attached Q
“ to his own sentiments, he declares, both m private and public, that

“ his sentiments are the absolute measure of my thoughts and ac-

“ tions. The rest of the courtiers are swayed by their personal 01·

“ faetious views; and how can Ι consult the monks on questions of

“ policy and marriage? I have yet much employment for your

“ diligence and fidelity. In the spring you shall engage one of my

‘.‘· brothers to solicit the succour of the Western powers3 from‘ the

‘⁶ *Morea you {hall sai-l to Cyprus on a particular commission ; and

“ from thence proceed to Georgia to receive and conduct the future

“ empress.” ““ Your commands,” replied Phranza, “ are irresist-

“ ible; but deign, great fir‚'' he added, with a serious smile, v ‘to

“ consider, that if I am thus perpetually absent from my family,

“ my vvife may be tempted either to' seek another husband, or to '

“· throw herself into a monastery. ” After laughing at hi's appre-

henfions‚ the emperor more gravely consoled him by the pleasmg
assurance, that this should be his last service abroad, and· that he
destined for his son, a wealthy and noble heiress3 for himself,
the important office of great logoth'ete, or prineipal minister of state.
The marriage was immediately stipulated3 but the office, however
incompatible with his own, had been usurped by the ambition of
the admiral. Some delay was req-uisite to negociate a consent* and
an equivalent; and the nomination of Phranza was half declare'd,
and half suppreffed, lest it might be displeafing to an insolent and
powerful favourite. The winter was spent in the preparations of his
embaffy3 and Phranza had resolved, that the youth his son should
embrace this opportunity of foreign travel, and be l'eft, on the
appearance of danger, vvith his maternal kindred of the Morea.
Such were the private and public defigas, which were interrupted
by a Turkish war, and finally buried in the ruins of the empire.
