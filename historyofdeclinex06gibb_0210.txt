THE DECLINE AND FALL

Sophia he presumed to place his throne on the right-hand of the
patriar0h3 and this presumption excited the sharpest censure of pope
Innocent the third. By a salutary efflet, one of the first examples
of the laws of mortmain, hc. prohibited the alienation of fiefs;
many of the Latios, defirous of returning to Europe, refigned their
estates to the chureh sor a spiritual or temporal reward3 these holy
lands were immediately discharged from military service; and a

the soldiers and the priests had been abundantly satisfied of his zeal
and valour. Vanity might applaud the elevation of a French
