OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The tempest of the Turkiss1 arms soon burst on his head ; and,
after the loss of Adrianople and Romania, he was enclosed in his
capital, the vass'al of the haughty Amurath‚ with the miserable hope
of being the last devoured by the savage. In this abjeet state,
Palaeologus embraced the resolution of embarking for Venice, and
casting himself at the feet of the pope; he was the first of the
Byzantine princes who had ever vifited the unknown regions of the
West, yet in them alone he could seek consolation or relief3 and
