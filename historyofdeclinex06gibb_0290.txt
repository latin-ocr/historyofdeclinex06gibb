72 TrHE DECLINE AND FALL

C ἐξιῇ. Ρ· Near fix *years the flame of discord burnt with various success and

war, and the plebeians; the Cantacuzeni and Palaeologi: and the Bul-
,3‘45-13’347„ garians, the Servians, and the Turks‚ were -invoked on both fides
as the ‚instruments of ‘priva-te ambition and the common ruin. The
regent deplored the cummines, of which he was the author and vic-

'tim : and his own experience might dietate a just and lively remark
on the different nature of foreign and civil war. “ The former,’'

said he, “ *isthe exteri-1211 warmth of summer, always tolerable, and

“ often beneficial; the latter is the deadly heat of a sever, which
‘⁶ consumes without a remedy the vitals of the constitution ²⁹.’'

V³⁶¹⁰¹Y of The intl‘Oduffifion of barbarians and savages into the contests of
{efficium civilized nations‚ is a measure pregnant with shame and mischief3

which the interest of the moment may compel, but which is repro-
bated by the best principles of humanity and reason. It is the prac-
tice of both fides to accuse their enemies of the guilt -of the first
alliance53 and those who fail in their negociations, are loudest in
their censure of the example which they envy, and would gladly
imitate. The Turks of Afia were less barbarous perhaps than the
ffiepherds of Bulgaria and Servia ; but their religion rendered them
the implacable foes of Rome and Christianity. To acquire the
friendlhip of their emim, the two ,factions >vied with each other in
baseness and profufion: the dexterity ,of Cantacuzene obtained the
preference: but the succour and victory were dearly purchased by
the marriage of his daughter with an infidel, the captivity of many
thousand Christians‚ and the passage of the Ottomans ‹into Europe,
the last and fatal stroke in the fall of the Roman empire. The in-
clining scale was decided in his favour by the death of Apocaucus,
the just, though singular, retribution of his crimes. A crowd of nobles
.or plebeiana, whom he feared or hated, had been seized by his orders

²⁹ Nic. Gregoms, 1. xii. e. 14· It is surpxifing, that Cantacuzene has not insemed this
just and lively image in his own writings.
