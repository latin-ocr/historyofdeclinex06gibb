did she often forget that if armed gallies were the effe& and ffistguard, c..-„---ae

merchant vessels were the cause and supply, of her greatness.

In her

religion, she avoided the schism of the Greeks, without yielding a scr-
vile obedience to the Roman pontiff ; and a free intercourse with the

infidels of every clime appears to have allayed betimes the sever of

superstition.

Her primitive government was a loose mixture of de-

mocracy and monarchy: the <loge was elected by the votes of the

general affembly3 as long as he was popular and· successful, he

reigned with the pomp and authority of a prince3 but in the fre-
quent revolutions of the state, he was deposed, or banilhed, or ssain,

by the justice or injustice of the multitude.

The twelfth century pro-

duced the first rudiments of the wife and jealous aristocracy, which
has reduced the doge to a pageant and the people to a cypher ³⁹.

WVhen the fix ambaffadors of the French pilgrims arrived at Venice,

they were hospitably entertained in the palace of St. Mark‚ by the

reigning duke: his name was Henry Dandolo ⁴⁰3 and he shone in

the last period of'human life as one of the most illustrioris charaeters

of the times.

Under the weight of years, and after the loss of

his eyes ⁴¹, Dandolo retained a sound understandiug and a manly

⁸⁹ The Venetians have been ssow in writ-
ing and publishing their history. Their most
ancient monuments are, 1. The rude Chro-
nicle (perhaps) of John Sagorninus (Venezia,
1755, in oc'tavo), which represents the state
aud manners of Venice in the year 1008.
z. The larger history of the doge (1342—
¹354) Andrew Dandolo, published for the
first time in the xitth tom. of Muratori, A. D.
1728. The History of Venice by the Abbe
Laugier (Paris, 1728), is a work of some
merit, which Ι have chiefly used sor the con-
stitutional part. .

⁴⁰ Henry Dandolo was eighty-seur at his
eleffion (A.D. 1192), and ninety-seven at
his death (A, D. 1205). See the Observa-

tions of Ducange sur Villehardouin, N0204. cange).

But this extraordinaty longevity is not ob-
served by the original writers, nor does there
exist another example of an hero near an

hundred years of age. Theophrastus might
afford an instance of a writer of ninety-nine3

but in stead ofzmzv-anmaffrooematd character),
I am much inclined to read {ssohum-:m with
his last editor Fischer, and the first thoughts
of casaubon. It is scarcely poffible that the
powers of the mind and body should support
themselves till such a period of life.

⁴¹ The modern Venetiam (Laugier‚tom.ii.
p. 119.) accuse the emperor Manuel: but
the calumny is refuted by Villehardouin and
the older writers, who suppose that Dandolo
lost his eyes by a wound (N0 34. and Du-
