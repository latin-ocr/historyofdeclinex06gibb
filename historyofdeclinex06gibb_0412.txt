THE DECLINE AND FALL

After his return, and the victory of Timour, Manuel reigned many
years in prosperity and peace. As long as the sons of Bajazet soli-
cited his friendship and spared his dominicus, he was satisfied with
the national religion; and his leisure was employed in composing
twenty theological dialogues for its defence. The appearance of the
Byzantine ambaffadors at the council of Constance³⁰ announces the
restoration of the Turkish power, as well as of the Latin church ς
the conquest of the sultans, Mahomet and Amurath‚ reconciled the
emperor to the vaticam and the siege of Constantinople almost
tempted him to acquiesce in the double proceffion of the Holy Ghost.
When Martin the fifth ascended without a rival the chair of St.

Peter, a friendly intercourse of letters and embaflies was revived
between the East and West. Ambition on one fide, and distress on

the other, dictated the same decent language of charity and peace:
th'e artful Greek expreffed a defire of marrying his fix sons to Italian
princeffes3 and the Roman, not less artful, dispatched the daughter
of the marquis of Montferrat, with a company of noble virgins, to
soften by their charms the obstinacy of the schismatics. Yet under
thiS mask of zeal, a discerning eye will perceive that all was hollow
and insincere in the court and church of Constantinople. According
to the viciflitudes of danger and repose, the emperor advanced or
retreated3 alternately instructed and disavowed his ministers ; and
escaped from an importunate preffure by urging the duty of en-
quiry, the obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs and
bithops, and the impoffibility of convening them at a time when the
Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a review of
the public transactions it will appear, that the Greeks infisted on
three sueceffive measures, a succour, a council, and a final re-union,
while the Latins eluded the second, and only promised the first, as
a consequential and voluntary reward of the third. But we have
