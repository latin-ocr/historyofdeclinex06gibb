day of his coronati0n3 and his shameful retreat was pursued by the
reproaches of the patriot bard ⁵⁶.

After the loss of liberty and empire, his third and more humble
wilh, was to reconcile the shepherd with his flock; to recal the
Roman bilhop to his ancient and peculiar diocese. In the fervour
of youth, with the authority of age, Petrarch addreffed his exhorta--
tions to five successive popes, and his eloquence was always inspired
by the enthusiasm of sentiment and the freedom of language⁵⁷.
The son of a citizen of Florence invariably preferred the country of
his birth to that of his education: and Italy, in his eyes, was the
queen and garden of the world. Amidst her domestic facimus, she
was doubtless superior to France both in art and science, in wealth
and politeness; but the difference could scarcely support the epithet ⁹
of barbarmrs, which he promiscuoussy bestows on the countries be-
yond the Alps. Avignon, the mystic Babylon, the smk of vice and
corruption, was the objec't of his hatred and contempt3 but he for-
gets that her scandalous vices were not the growth of the soil, and
thatin every refidence they would adhere to the power and luxury of
the papal court. He confeffes, that the successor of St. Peter is the
bishop of the universal church3 yet it was not on the banks of the
Rhome, but of the Tyber, that the apostle had fixed his everlasting
throne: and while every city in the Christian world was bleffed
with a bithop, the metropolis alone was desolate and forlorn. Since
the removal of the Holy See, the sacred buildings of the Lateran
and the Vatican, their altars and their saints, were left in a state of
poverty and decay3 and Rome was often painted under the image
