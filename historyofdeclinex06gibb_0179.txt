and contemptible: the base and spurious race of the Angeli was re-
jected with clamorous disdain ; and the people of Constantinople
encompaffed the senate, t'o demand at their hands a more worthy
emperor. To every senator, conspicuous by his birth or dignity‚
they succeffively presented the purple: by each senator the deadly

had contrived his escape by a private staircase. But that staircase
terminated in a prison ; Alexius was seized, stripped, and loaded
with chains3 and, after tasting some days the bitterness of death,
