laborious 3 no more than ten votaries os Homer could be enume-

rated in all Italy3 and neither Rome, nor Venice, nor Naples, could

add a single name to this studious catalogue. But their numbers

would have multiplied, their progress would have been accelerated,

if the inconstant Leo, at the end of three years, had not relin-

quished an honourable and beneficial station. In his passage, Pe-K

trarch entertained him at Padua a short time; he enjoyed the scholar,

but was justly offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the

man. Diseontented with the world and with himself, Leo depre-
ciated his present enjoyments, while absent persons and objed'cs were
dear to his imagination. In Italy he was a Thessalian, in Greeee a
native of Calabria; in the company of the Latins he disdained their
language, religion, and manner; no sooner was he landed at Con-
stantinople, than he again fighed for the wealth of Venice and the
elegance⁴of Florence. His Italian friends were deaf to his impor-
tunity; he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and em-
barked on a second voyage3 but on his entrance into the Adriatic,

the ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate teacher, who
like Ulyffes had fastened himself to the mast, was struck dead by a
flash of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropt a tear on his dis-
aster3 but he was most anxious to learn whether some copy of

Euripides or Sophocles might not be saved from the hands of the
mariners ⁹⁵.
