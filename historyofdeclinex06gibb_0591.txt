OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 573

the patriot was reduced to a fingle gai-ment and the charity of the C {¹50²} P·
hospital. From this misery he was relieved by the sense of merit ι--Η

or the smile of favour3 and the employment of apostolic notary
afforded him a daily stipend of five gold florina, a more honourable
and extensive conneffion, and the right of contrasting, both in words
and affions, his own integrity with the vices of the state. The
eloquence of Rienzi was prompt and persuafive: the multitude is
always prone to envy and censure: he was stimulated by the loss
of a brother and the impunity of the affaffins; nor was it poffible
to excuse or exaggerate the public calamities. The bleffings of
peace and justice, for which civil society has been instituted, were
banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who might have en·-
dured every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply
wounded in the dishonour of their wives and daughters ²²: they
were equally oppreffed by the arrogance of the nobles and the cor-
ruption of the magistrates; and the abuse of arms or of laws was
the only circumstance that distinguished the lions, from the dogs and
serpentS‚ of the Capitol. These allegorical emblems were varioussy
repeated in the pffl'cmes which Rienzi exhibited in the streets and
churches; and while the specstators gazed with curious wonder, the
bold and ready orator unfolded the meaning, applied the satire, in-
ftflamed their paffions, and announccd a distant hope of comfort and
deliverance. The privileges of Rome, her eternal sovereignty over
her princes and provinces, was the theme of his public and private
’ discourse ; and a monument of servitude became in his hands a title
and incentive of liberty. The decree of the senate, which granted
the most ample prerogatives to the emperor Vespafian, had been
inscribed on a copper·plate still extant in the choir of the church of
St. John Lateran ²³. A numerous affembly of ¹nobles and >plebeians
