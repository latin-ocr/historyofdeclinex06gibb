pray ed and fasted three nights on a mountain, that the Mogul em- ’.μγ-4,

peror appealed to the judgment of God and his sword. Our Eu..
ropean battles, says a philosophie writer ²⁰, are petty skirmissies, if

compared to the numbers that have fought and fallen in the fields ⁵

of Afia. Seven hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars are saidto
have marched under the standard of Zingis and his four sons. In
the vast plains that extend to the north of the Sihon or Jaxartes,
they were encountered by four hundred thousand soldiers of the
fultan3 and in the first battle, which was suspended by the night, one
hundred and sixty thousand Cal-izmians were ssain. Mohammed was
astonished by the multitude and valour of his enemies: he'withdrew
from the scene of danger, and distributed his tloops in the frontier>
towns, trusting that the Barbarians, invineible in the field, would be
repulsed by the length and difficulty of so many regular fieges. But
the prudence of Zingis had Iormed a body of Chinese engineers,
{killed in the mechanic arts‚ informed perhaps of the secret of gun-
powder, and capable, under his discipline, of attacking a foreign
country with more vigour and success than they had defended their
own. The Persian historians will relate the fieges and reduetion of
Οἰνεῖ, Cogende, Bochara, Samarcand, Carizme, Herat, Merou, Nisa-
bour, Baleh, and> Candahar; and the conquest of the rich and·
populous countries of Transoxiana, Car-inne, and Chorasan. The
destruCrive hostilities of Attila and the Huns have long fince been
elucidated by the example of Zingis and the Moguls; and in this*
.more proper place Ι shall be content to observe, that, from the· Caspian
to the Indus, they ruined a' tm& of many hundred miles, which was
adorned with the habitations and labours of mankind, and that five
centuries have not been> sufficient to repair the ravages of four years,
