THE DECLINE AND FALL

This melancholy picture was drawn above nine hundred years
after the fall of the western empire, and even of the Gothic king-
dom of Italy. A long period of distress and anarchy, in which
empire, and arta, and riches, had migrated from the banks of the
Tyber, was incapable of restoring or adorning the city3 and, as all
that is human must retrograde if it do not advance, every succeffive
age must have hastened the ruin of the works of antiquity. To
measure the progress of decay, and to ascertain at each aera the state
of each edifice, would be an endless and a useless labour, and Ι
shall content myself with two observations which will introduce a
short enquiry into the general causes and essedis. 1. Two hundred
years before the eloquent complaint of Poggius, an anonymous
writer composed a description of Rome ⁶. His ignoranee may re·-

peat the same objeecs under strange and fabulous names. Yet this
barbarous topographer had eyes and ears, he could observe the
vifible remains, he could listen to the tradition of the people, and
he distinffly enumerates seven theatres‚ eleven baths, twelve arches,
and eighteen palaces, of which many had disappeared before the
time of Poggius. It is apparent, that many stately monuments of
antiquity survived till a late period ⁷, and that the principles of de-
struCtion aeted with vigorous and encreasing energy in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries. 2. The same reflecti-on must be applied
to the three last ages3 and we should vainly seek the Septizonium of

Severus ³, which is celebrated by Petrarch and the antiquarians of

theca St.1s1d0ri Armario IV. N0 69. This
neatise, with some {hort but pertinent notes,
has been publiihed by Montfaucon (Diarium
Italicum, p. εἲς-ψῃ), who thus delivers
his own critical opinion : Scriptor xiiimi cir-
c‘iter saeculi, ut ibidem notatum antiquariae
rei imperitus,et‚ ut ab illo aevo, nugis et anili-
bus fabellis refertus: sed, quia monumenta
quae iis temporibus Romae supererant pro mo-
dulo recenset, non parum inde lucis mutua-

⁷ The Pere Mabillon (Analetsta, tom. iv.
p. 502.) has publiihed an anonymous pilgrim
of the ix¹¹¹ century, who, in his visit round
the churches and holy places ofRome, touches
on several buildings, especially porticoes,
which had disappeared before the xiii‘h cen-
tury.
