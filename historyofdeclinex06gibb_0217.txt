lordstiip of Courtenay, the last remains of his inheritance ⁴⁷. By
fueh shameful or ruinous expedients, he once more returned to Ro-
mania, with an army of thirty thousand soldiers‚ whose numbers
were doubled in the apprehenfion of the Greeks. His first dispatches
to France and England announced his victories and his hopes: he
had reduced the country round the capital to the distance of three
days journey; and if he succeeded against an important, though
nameless, city (most probably Chiorli), the frontier would be safe
and the paffage acceflible. But these expe&ations (if Baldwin was
fineere) quickly vanished like a dream3 the troops and treasures of
France melted away in his unss<ilful hands; and the throne of the
Latin emperor was protected by a dishonourable alliance with the
Turks and Comans. To secure the former, he consented to bestow
his niece on the unbelieving sultan of Cogni3 to please the latter,
he complied with their Pagan rites; a dog was sacrificed between
the two armie33 and the contracting parties tasted each other's
blood, as a pledge of their fidelity⁴⁸. In the palace or prison of
, Constantinople, the successor of Augustus demolissied the vacant
houses for winter-fuel, and stripped the lead from the churches for
the daily expence of his family. Some usurious loans were dealt:
with a scanty hand by the merchants of Italy3 and Philip, his son
and heir, was pawned at Venice as the security for a debt ⁴⁹. Thirst,
hunger, and nakedness, are positive evils3 but wealth is relative3
