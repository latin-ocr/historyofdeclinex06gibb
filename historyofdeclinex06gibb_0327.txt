⁴ The subsequent invafions of a Scythiam cast were those of outlaws ι-Ν

and fugitive85 and some thousands os Alani and Comans, who had
been driven from their -native scats, were reclaimed from a vagi-ant
life, and enlisted in the service of the empire. Such was the in-
fluence in Europe of the invafion of the Moguls. The first terror
of their arms secured, rather than disturbed, the peace of the Roman
Afia. The sultan of Iconium solicited a personal interview with
John Vatace83 and his artful policy encouraged the Tul-ks to defend

soon overthrovvn3 and the servitude and ruin of the Seljukians ex-
posed the nakedness of the Greeks. The formidable Holagou
'threatened to march to Constantinople at the head of four hundred
thousand men; and the groundless panic of the citizens of Nice
will present »an image of the terror which he had inspired. The
accident of a processum, and the found of a doleful litany‚ “ From

who knew not from what or to whom they fled3 and some hours
elapsed before the firmness of the military Officers could relieve the
city from this imaginary foe. But the ambition of Holagou and his
successors was fortunately diverted by the conquest of Bagdad, and a
long vicissitude of Syrian wars: their hostility to the Mossems in-
clined them to unite with the Greeks and Franks ³⁷; and their gene-
rofity or contempt had offered the kingdom of Anatolia as the
reward of an Armenian vaffitl. The fragments of the Seljukian
