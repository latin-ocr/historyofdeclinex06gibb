assiance, and the dignity of Caesar, had connee‘ced with the Imperial
family the two elder brothers of Boniface ⁵¹: he expedted to dci-ive
a kingdom from the important service3 and the more gencrous am-

¹that as soon as they should be seated on the throne of Constanti-

oaths and sea1s; and each individual, according to his situation and
character, was swayed by the hope of public or private advantage3
