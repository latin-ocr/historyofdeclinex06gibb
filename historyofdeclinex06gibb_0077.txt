ably directed against the northern and western fides of the city.
Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on the first swell of mount

first barrier, but they were driven back with shame and ssaughter
to the camp: the influence of vifion and prophecy was deadened
by the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and
