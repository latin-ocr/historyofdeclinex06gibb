whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious.

‘The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had re-
‹ceived from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the

right of defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend
a severe revenge from an hero of the same nation, and who was
engaged in the same cause. But, after weighing the motives and
the events, the virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and
misfortunes of his worthless brethrer13 and his twelve depudes, the'
meffengers of peace, requested in his name a free paffage and an
equal market. To remove their suspicions, Godfrey trusted himself,
and afterwards his brother, to the saith of Carloman king of Hun-
gary, who treated them with a fimple but hospitable entertainment:
the treaty was sanctified by their common gospel ; and a proclama-
tion, under pain of death, restrained the animosity and licence of the

Latin soldiers. From Austria to Belgrade, they traversed the plains

-of Hungary, without enduring or offering an injury3 and the

proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his nu-

merous cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for their safety than
for his own. They reached the banks of the Save3 and no sooner

«had they paffed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the

hostages, and saluted their departure with the fairest wilhes for the
success of their enterprise, With the same conduct and. discipline,
Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers of Thrace;
and might congratulate himself, that he had almost reached the first
term of his pilgrimage, without drawing his sword against a Chris-
tian adversary. After an easy and pleasant journey through Lom-
bardy, from Turin to Aquileia, Raymond and his provincials marched
forty days through the savage country of Dalmatia ⁵⁹ and Sclavonia.
