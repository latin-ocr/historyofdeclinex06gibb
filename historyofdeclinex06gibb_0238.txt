μανψ vived by the patents of succeeding princes. But there still survived

a lineal descendant of Hugh the first earl of Devon, a younger ’
branch of the Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham
castle above four hundred years from the reign of Edward the third
to the present hour. Their estates have been encreased by the grant
and improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently
restored to the honours of the peerage. Yet the Courtenays still re-

the fall, of their ancient house ⁸⁶. While they sigh for past greatness,
they are doubtless senfible of present bleffings: in the long series of
the Courtenay annals, the most splendid aera is likevvise the most un-
fortunate3 nor can an opulent peer of Britain be inclined to envy
the emperors of Constanfinople, who wandered over Europe to solicit

alms for the support of their dignity and the defence of their ca-
pital.

was probably adopted by the Powderham which seem to denote their affinity with God-
branch, after the loss of the earldom of De· frey of Bouillon, and the ancient counts of
