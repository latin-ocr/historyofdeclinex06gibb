OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the engines of affault3 a numerous garrison might be lodged in the
enclosu1·e; and while one faction occupied the Vatican and the
Capitol, the other was intrenched in the Lateran and the Coli-
stum”.

The abolition at Rome of the ancient games must be understood
with some latitude ; and the carnival sports, of the Testacean mount
and the Circus Agonalis⁵⁴‚ were regulated by the law ⁵⁵ or custom of
the city. The senator prestded with dignity and pomp to adjudge
and distribute the prizes, the gold ring, or the pallium ⁵⁵, as it was
styled, of eloth or filk. A tribute on the Jews supplied the annual
expence⁵⁷; and the races, on foot, οη horseback‚ or in chariots,
were ennobled by a tilt and tournament of seventy-two of the Ro-
man youth. In the year one thousand three hundred and thirty-
two, a buu-feast, after the fastiion of the Moors and Spaniards, was
celebrated in the Coliseum itself; and the living manners are painted
in a.<fiary of the thnes⁵h f& convenient order of benches uvas
restored 3 and a general proclamation, as far as Rimini and Ravenna,

⁵³ 1 cannot recover in Muratori’s original
Lives of the Popes (Script. Rerum Italicarum,
tom. iii. P. i.) the passage that attests this
hostile partition, which must be applied to the
end of the x'r‘h or the beginning of the xii¹h
century.

⁵⁴ Although the straciure of the Circus
Agonalis be destroyed, it still retains its form
and name (Agona, Nagona‚ Navcna): and
the interior space affords a sufficient level
for the purpose of racing. But the Monte

‚ Testaeeo, that strange pile of broken pottery,

seems only adapted for the annual praflice
ofhurling from top to bottom some waggon-
loads oflive hogs for the diversion of the po·-
pulace (Statuta Urbis Romae, p. 186.).

⁵⁵ See the statuta Urbis Romae, l. iii.

c. 87, 88, 89. p. 185, 186. 1 have already
given an idea of this municipal code. The
taces of Nagona and Monte 'sestaceo are
likewise mentioned in the Diary of Peter

Antonius from ¹404 to ¹4¹7 (Muratori,

3

Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. xxiv. p.1124.).

⁵⁶ The pallium, which Menage so foolishly
derives from palmarium, is an easy extension
of the idea and the wordS, from the robe or
cloak, to the materials‚ and from thence to
their application as a prize (Muratori, dis-
sert. xxxiii.).

⁵⁷ For these expences, the Jews of Rome
paid each year ¹¹30 florius, of which the odd
thirty represented the pieces of filver for
which Judas had betrayed his master to theii-
ancestors. There was a foot-race of vaish,
as well as of Christian youths (Statuta Urbis,
ibidem).

⁵³ This extraordinary bull-feastin the Co-
liseum, is described from tradition, rather
than memory, by Ludovico Buonconte Mo-
naldesto, in the most ancient fragments of
Roman annals (Muratori, Script. Rerum Ita,-
licarurn, tom. xii. p. 535, 536.): and how-
ever fanciful they may seem, they are deeply
marked with the colo-ars of truth aud nature·
