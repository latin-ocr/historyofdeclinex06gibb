a-,rd third was alike impotem in his persona] character and his Imperial

dignity. Λ long war had impaired the strength, without satiating
the animosity of France and England¹⁷2 but Philip, duke of Bur-
gundy, was a vain and magnificent prince3 and he enjoyed, without
danger or ex'pcnce‚ the adventurous piety of his subjects, who saile'd,
in a gallant fleet, from the coast of Flanders to the Hellespont.
The maritime republics of Venice and Genoa were less remote from
the scene of acti0n3 and their hostile fieets were associated under
the standard of St„ Peter. The kingdoms of Hungary and Poland,
which covered as it were the interior pale of the Latin chureh, were
the most nearly concerned to oppose the progress of the Turks..''
Arme were the patrimony of the Scythians and Sarmatiam, and these
nati—ons might appear equal to the contest, could they point, against
the common foe, those svvords that were so wantonly drawn in
bloody and domestic quarrels. But the same spirit was adverse to*
concord and obedience : a poor country and. a limited‘ monarch are,
incapable of maintaining a standing force; and the loose bodies of
Polish and Hungarian horse were not armed with the sentiments
and weapons which, on some occaslons, have given irrefistible
weight to the French chivalry'. Yet, on this fide, the designs of'the
Roman pontiff, and the eloquence of cardinal Julian, his legate, were

promoted by the circumstances of the times¹⁸3 by the union of the

de Basse, tom.i. p.318.)-. At the {iege of
Nuys on the Rhlne in 1474, the princes,
prelates‚ and cities. sent their respective
quotas: and the bishop ofMunster (qui n'est
pas des plus grands) fur-niihed 1400 horse,
6000 soor, all in green, with 1200 waggons.
The united armies of the king of England
and the duke of Burgundy scarcely equalled
one-third of this German host (Memoires de
Philippe de Comines, l. iv. e. z.). At pre-
sent, fix or seven hundred thousand rnen are
maintained in constant pay and admirable
discipline, by the powers of Germany.

France and England could agree oa a truce
ofsome months (See Rymer’s Foedera, and
the chronicles of both natione).

¹¹⁵ In the Hungarian crusede, ‘spondanus
(Annal. Eccles. A. D. 1443, 1444.) has been
my leading guide. He has diligently read,
and critically compared, the Grec-k and
Turkish materials‚ the historians ofHungary‚
Poland, and the West. His narrative is per-
spicuous; and where he can be free from a
religious bias, the judgment of spondanus is
not contemptible.
