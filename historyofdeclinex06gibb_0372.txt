They were on the spot to receive the earliest and most
faithful intelligcnce of the overthrow of their great adversary; and
it is more than probable, that some of them accompanied the Greek
embaffy to the camp of Tamerlane. From their account, the hard-
Jhips of the prison and death of Bajazet are affirmed by the marshal's
servant and historiam, within the distance of seven years ⁴⁹. 2. The
name of Poggius the Italian ⁵⁰ is deservedly famous among the re-
vivers of learning in the fifteenth century. His elegant dialogue on
the viciffitudes of fortune ⁵¹ was composed in his fiftieth year, twenty-
eight years after the Turkish viCtory of Tamerlane⁵²3 whom he cele-
brates as not inferior to the illustrious Barbariana of antiquity. Of his
exploits and discipline Poggius was informed by several ocularwitneffes3

These memoirs were composed while the mar-
shal was still governor of Genoa, from
whence he was expelled in the year 1409, by
a popular insurreftion (Muratori, Annali
dualia, tom. xii. p. 473, 474.).

⁵0 The reader will find a satisfactory ac-
count of the life and writings of Poggius, in
the Poggiana, an entertaining work of M.
Lenfant, and in the Bibliotheca Latina mediae
et infimae AEtatis of Fabricius (tom. v. p. 305
—308.). Poggius was born in the year 1380,
and died in ¹459·

both contemporaries, and both chancellots,
the one of Trevigi‚ the other of Ferrara. The·
