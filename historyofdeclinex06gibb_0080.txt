κι-..γ-Ἀ His magnanimity accepted a trust as full of danger as of glory3 but
in a city where his Saviour had been crowned with thorns, the de·
vout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of royalty; and the
founder 'of the kingdom of Jerusalem contented himself with the
modest title of Defendet and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His

council and astion, had been swept away in the last‘plague of An- .
