OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

descended from the Alps. I have described the peaceful order of his
entry and coronation; but that order was commonly disturbcd by
the clamour and sedition Of the Romans, who encountcred their
sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure was always speedy, and
often {hameful; and, in the absence of a long reign,1113 authority
was insulted and his name was forgotten. The progress of inde-
pendence in Germany and Italy undermined the foundations of the
Imperial sovereignty‚ and the triumph of the popes was the deli-

Of her two sovereigns‚ the emperor had precarioussy reigned by
the right of conquest3 but the authority of the pope was founded

in the ignorance and tradition of ‘four centuries: and the fabulous ori-
gin was lost in the real and permanent effeets. The name of Dominus
or Lord-was inscribed on the coin of the bissiops : their title was ac-
knowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance, and with the
free, or reluctant, consent of the German Caesar-s, they had long
