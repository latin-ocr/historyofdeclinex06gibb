tinguissiing the schism, the rashness of the French and Italians had
given a third pretender to the chair of St. Peter. Such new claims
of the synod and concl'ave were disputed: three kings, of Germany,
Hungmy, and Naples‚ adhered to the cause ofGregory the twelfth3⁴
and Benedi& the thirteenth, himself a Spaniam), was acknowledged
by the devotion and'patriotism of that powerful nation. The rass1
proceedings of Pisa were corrected by the council⁴ of Constance ; the
emperor Sigismond adsted a conspicuous part as the advocate or pro-

of Rimini, descended with more honour from the throne, and his
ambaffador convened the seffion, in which he renounced the title

sohtary castle to- excommunicate twice each day the rebel kingdoms
which had deserted his cause. After thus eradicating the remains
of the schism, the synod of Constante proceeded with ssow and cau-
tious steps, to ele& the sovereign of Rome and the head of the church.
On this momentous occafion, the college of twenty-three cardinals
was fortified with thirty deputies; fix of whom were chosen in each
