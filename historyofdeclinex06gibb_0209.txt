or THE RoMAN EMPIRE. 191

Calo-John inflicied or suffered: hc was stabbed in the night in his C iix? P.
tent3 and the general, perhaps the affaflin, who found him-welter- κ--ν-ι

ing in his blood, ascribed the blow with general applause to the lance
of St. Demetrius ³³. After several vistories, the prudence of Henry
concludcd an honourable peace with the successor of the tyram, and
with the Greek princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded some
doubtful limits‚ an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his
feudatories3 and his reign, which last-ed only ten years, afforded a
short interval of prosperity and peace. Far above the narrow policy
of Baldwin and Boniface, he freely entrusted to the Greeks the most
important offices of the state and army: and this liberality of sen-
timent and pradiice, was the more seasonable‚ as the princes of Nice
and Epirus had already learned to seduce and employ the mercenary
valour of the Latius. It was the aim of Henry to unite and reward
his deserving subjeets of every nation and language3 but he ap-
peared less solicitous to accomplish the impracticable union of the
two churches. Pelagius, the pope's legate, who acted as the sove-
reign of Constantinople, had interdicted the worship of the Greeks,
and sternly imposed the payment of tithes, the double proceflion of
the Holy Ghost, and a blind obedience to the Roman pontiff. As
the weaker party, they pleaded the duties of conscience, and implored
the rights of toleration: “ Our bodies,’' they said, “ are Caesir’s,
“ but our souls belong only to God.” The persecution was checked

³ by the firmness, of the emperor-³⁴3 and if we can believe that the lanne

prince was poisoned by the Greeks themselves, we must entertain a
contemptible idea of the sense and gratitude of mankind. His valour
was a vulgar attribute, which he {hared with ten thousand knights-5,
but Henry possessed the superior courage to oppose‚ in a superstitious
age, the pride and avarice of the clergy. In the cathedral of St.
