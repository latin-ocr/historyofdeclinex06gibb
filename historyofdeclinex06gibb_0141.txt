oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE,

a statesman‚ and the prince descends to the passions and prejudiceg
of a priest ⁵. But the orthodoxy of Rome spontaneoussy obeyed the
impulse of her temporal policy3 and the filioque, which Leo wished
to erase, was transcribed in the symbol and chaunted in the liturgy
of the Vatican. The Nicene and Athanafian creeds are held as the Ca.
tholic saith, without which none can be saved 3 and both Papists and
Protestants must now sustain and return the anathemas of the Greeks,
who deny the proceffion of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as
from the Father. Such articles of faith are not susceptible of treaty3
but the rules of discipline will vary in remote and independent
churches; and the reason, even of divines, might allow, that the dif-
ference is inevitable and harmless. The craft or superstition of Rome
has imposed‘ on‘her priests and deacons the rigid obligation of celi-
bacy3 among the Greeks, it is confined to the bishops ; the loss is
compensated by dignity or annihilated by age; and the parochial
clergy, the papas, enjoy the conjugal society of the wives whom
they have married before their entrance into holy orders. A question
concerning the Azyms was fiercely debated in the eleventh century,
and the effence of the Eucharist was supposed in the East and West,
to depend on the use of leavened or unleavened bread. Shall I men-

tion in a serious history the furious reproaches that were urged
against the Latins, who, for a long while remained on the defenfive?
They neglected to abstain, according to the apostolical decree, from
things strangled, and from blood : they fasted, a Jewish observance!
on the Saturday of each week: during the first week of Lent they per-
mitted the use of milk and cheese⁶; their infirm monks were indulged
in the taste of flelh ; and animal grease was substituted for the want
