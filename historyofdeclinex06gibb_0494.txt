476 THE ‘DECLINE AND FALL*

“ngvsslf'· first experiment ; but, to prevent the sudden and mischievous effe&

u-f-ssa of astonissrment and fear, a proclamation was ifl'ued, that the cannon
would be discharged the ensuing day. The explofion was felt or
heard in a circuit of an hundred furlongs : the bau, by the force of
gunpovvder‚ was driven above a mile 3 and on the spot where it fell,
it buried itself a fathom deep in the ground. For the conveyance of this
destructive engine, a frame or carriage of thirty waggons was linked
together and drawn along by a team of fixty oxen: tvvo hundred
rnen on both fides were stationed to poise and support the rolling weight;
two hundred and fifty workrnen marched before to smooth the way
and repair the bridges; and near two months were employed in a
laborious journey of one hundred and fifty miles. A lively philo-
sopher ²⁵ derides on this occaslon the credulity of the Greeks, and
observes, with much reason, that we should always distrust the ex-
aggeratione, of a vanquilhed people. He calculates, that a ball, even.
of two hundred pounds, would require a charge of one hundred and
fifty pounds of powder3 and that the stroke would be-feeble and
impotem, fince not a fifteenth part of the mass could be inflamed atr
the same moment. A stranger as I am to the art of destruCtion, I
can discern that the modern improvements of artillery prefer the,
number of pieces to the weight of meta13 the quickness of the fire.

Idare not rejest the positive and unanimous evidence of contem-

their rude and ambitione efforts, should have transgreffed the stand-
ard of moderation. A Turkish cannon, more enormous than that
of Mahomet, still guarda the entrance of the Dardanelle83 and ifi-
the use be inconvenient, it has been found on a late trial that the. “
