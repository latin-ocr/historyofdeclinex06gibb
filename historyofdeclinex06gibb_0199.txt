horror and contempt to those who with more propriety could

hate, and with more justice could punish, the affaffin of the emperor
Isaac, and his son. As the tyram, pursued by fear or remorse, was
stealing over to Afia, he was seized by the Latius of Constanti-
nople, and condemned, after an open trial, to an ignominious death.
His judges debated the mode of his execution, the axe, the wheel,
or the stake3 and it was resolved that Mourzoufle ¹⁷ should ascend
the Theodofian column, a pillar of white marble of one hundred
and forty-seven feet in heightffl. From the summit he was cast
down headlong, and dashed in pieces on the pavement, in the pre·
sence of innumerable spectators, who filled the forum of Taurus,
and admired the accomplishment of an old prediction, which was
explained by this singular event¹⁹. The fate of Alexius is less tra-
gical: he was sent by the marquis a captive to Italy, and a gift to
the king of the Romans; but he had not much to applaud his for-

for a tyn-ant or rebel, whose punishment, how-
ever, was more unexampled than his crime.

¹⁹ The nonsense oqunther and the mo-
dern Greeks concerning this columnafatidiea‚
is unworthy of notice: but it is fingular
enough, that fifty years before the Latin con-
quest, the poet Tzetzes (Cffiliad, ix. 277.)
relates the dream of a matron‚ who saw an
army in the forum, and a man fitting on
the column, clapping his hands, and utter-
