were surely less formidable than the calamities of a civil war, in
which the Barbarians and infidels were again invited to affist the
Greeks in their mutual destruaion. By the arms of the Tin-ks, who
now struck a deep and everlasting root in Europe, Cantacuzene
prevailed in the third contest in which he had been involved ; and
the young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was compelled to
take ssielter among the Latins of the isse of Tenedos. His insolence
and obstinacy provoked the victor to a step which must render the
