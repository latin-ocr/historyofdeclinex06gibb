THE DECLINE AND FALL

saluting the threshold of the apostles, and imploring the protection
of pope Innocent the third, Alexius accepted the kind invitation os
his fister Irene, the wife of Philip of Swabia, king of the Romans,
But in his paffage through Italy, he heard that the flower of XVestern
chivalry was assembled at Venice for the deliverance of the Holy
Land; and a ray of hope was kindled in his bosom, that 'their in·-
vincible swords might be employed in his father’s restoration.

About ten or twelve years after the loss of Jerusalem, the nobles
of France were again summoned to the holy war by the voice of a2

forsook his parochial duty, to assume the more flattering charadier

and miracles was spread over the land5 he declairned, with severityJ
and vehemence, against the vices of the age3 and his sermons,

in person, or two years by a substitute²⁷3 and among his legates
and orator-s who blew the sacred trumpet, Fulk of Neuilly was the
