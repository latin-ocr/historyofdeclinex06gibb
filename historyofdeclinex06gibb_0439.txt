OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 421

The prize which eluded the efforts of Ferrarch, was obtained by C ΕΝΑΙ Ρ·

the fortune and industry of his friend Boecace ⁹³, the father of the κ-Ὓ--Ι

Tuscan prose. That popular writer, who derives his reputation from ἓξιξῗειςξόεὲἱ

the Decameron, an hundred novels of pleasantry and love, may ἅτ’

aspire to the more serious praise of restoring in Italy the study of
the Greek language; In the year one thousand three hundred and
fixty, a disciple of Barlaam, whose name was Leo, or Leontius
Pilatus, was detained in his way to Avignon by 'the advice and
hospitality of Boecace, who lodged the stranger in his house, pre-

a treasure of Greek learning: history and fable‚ philosophy and

Homer 'm the schools of Florence. It was from his explanation
that Boecace composed and transcribed a litera! prose verslon of the
Iliad and Odyffey, which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch‚
and which perhaps, in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used
by Laurentius Valla, the Latin interpreter. It was from his narra-

the genealogy of the heathen gods, a work, in that age, of stupen-
