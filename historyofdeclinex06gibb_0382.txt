THE DEGLINE AND FALL

a perse& monarchy. 4. Whatsoever might be the bleffings of his
administration, they evnporated with his life. To reign, rather than
to govern, was the ambition of his children and g1·andchildi·en⁷⁰; the
enemies of each other and of the people. A fragment of the em-
-pire was upheld¹ with some glory by Sharok'n his youngest son ; but
after his decease, the scene was again involved in darkness and blood3
and before the end of a century, Transoxiana and Persia were

trampled by the Uzbeks from the north, and the Turkmans of the

black and white sheep. The race of Timour would have been ex-
ῐίῃᾶ, if an her0, his descendant in the fifth degree, had not fled be-
fore the Uzbek arms to the conquest of Hindostan. His successors
(the great Moguls⁷¹) extended their sway from the mountains of
Cashmir to Cape Comorin, and from Candahar to the gulf of Bengal.
Since the reign of Aurungzebe, their empire has been diffolved; their
treasures of Delhi have been rifled by a Persian robber3 and the
richest of their kingdoms is now poss'effed by a company of Chris-
tian merchants, of a remote issand in the Northern ocean.

Far different was the fate of the Ottoman monarchy. The maffy
trunk was bent to the ground, but no sooner did the hurricane pass
away, than it again rose with fresh vigour and more lively vegeta-
tion. 'When Timour, in every sense, had evacuated Anatolia, he
left the cities without a palace, a treasure, or a king. The open
country was overspread with hords of shepherds and robbers of Tar-
tar or Turkman origin3 the recent conquests of Bajazet were re—
stored to the emirs, one of whom, in base revenge, demolissied his
sepulchre3 and his five sons were cager, by civil discord‚ to con-sume
the remnant of their patrimony. I shall enumerate their names in
