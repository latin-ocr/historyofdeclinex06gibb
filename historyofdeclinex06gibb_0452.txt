pared and celebrated by an eloquent Greek the father of the
Italian schools¹. The view of the ancient capital, the seat of his an-
cestorS, surpaffed the most sanguine expectations of Emanuel Chry-
soloras3 and he no longer blamed the exclamation of an old sophist,
that Rome was the habitation, not of men, but of gods. Those
gods, and those men, had long smce vanished5 but, to the eye of

liberal enthufiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image of her an-

cient prosperity. The monuments of the consuls and Caesars, of the

martyrs and apostles, engaged on all fides the curiofity of the phi-
losopher and the Christian 3 and he confeffed‚ that in every age the
arms and the religion of Rome vvere destined to reign over the
earth. While Chrysoloras admired the venerable beauties of the

mother, he was not forgetful of his native, country,· her fiairest
daughter, her Imperial colony3 and the Byzantine patriot expatiates

¹ The epistle of Manuel Chrysoloras to

the emperor John palaeologus, will not offend
the eye o! ear of a classical student (ad calcem
codini de Antiquitatibus C. P. p. 107—
1 26.). The superscription suggests a chronolo-
gical remark, that John Palaeologus 11. was

associated in the empire before the year 1414,
the date of Chrysoloras’s death. A still
earlier date, at least 1408, is deduced from
the age of his youngest sons, Demetrius and
Thomas, who were both Porphyrogeniti (Du-
cange‚ Fam. Byzant. p. ²44· 247.).
