OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Under the reign of Sixtus the fourth, Rome was dist1·a&ed by the

palace, the protonotary Colonna was tortured and beheaded3 and

to join in the acclamations of the vistorious Ursini ⁸⁶. But the
popes no longer trembled in the Vatican: they had strength to com-
mand, if they had resolution to claim, the obedience of their sub-
jee‘133 and the strangers, who observed these partial disorders, ad-
mired the easy taxes and wife administration of the ecclefiastical

state ⁸⁷.
