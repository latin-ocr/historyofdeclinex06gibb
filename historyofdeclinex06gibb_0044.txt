valry formed the strength of the armies, and the honourable name
of miles, or soldier, was confined to the gentlemen⁵⁵ who served on

‘horseback, and were invested with the character of knighthood.

The dukes and counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty,
divided the provinces among their faithful barons: the barons distri-
buted among their vaffals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiaeffion ς.
and these military tenants, the peers of each other and of their lord,
composed the noble or equestrian order, which disdained to conceive ’
