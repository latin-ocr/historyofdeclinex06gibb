ness by the pretence of justice and levenge. The downfal and
death os the sultan Moharnmed, who expired unpitied and alone,
in a desert issand of the Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement for tlte
calamities of which he was the author. Could the Carizmian em-

pire have been saved by a fingle hero, it would have been saved by
his son Gelaleddin, whose affitive valour repeatedly checked the
Moguls in the career -of victory. Retreating, as he fought, to the
banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their innumerable host,

till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin spurred his horse into
the waves, swam one of the broadest and most rapid rivers of Asta,

and extorted the admiration and applause of Zingis himself. It was
in this camp that the Mogul conqueror yielded with reldctance to
the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who fighed for the
enjoyment of their native land. Incumbered with the spoils of Asia,
he ssowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the
misery os the vanquissred, and declared his intention of rebuilding
the cities which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms.
After he had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes, he was joined by two

generals, whom he had detached with thirty thousand horse, to sub-

due the western provinces of Perfia. They had trampled on the
nations which opposed their paffage, penetrated through the gates

of Derbend, traversed the Volga and the Defert, and accomplished »

the circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an expedition which had never

been attempted, and has never been repeated. The return of Zingis ‘

was fignalized by the overthrow of ‘the rebellious or independent
kingdoms of Tartary5 and he died in the fulness of years and glory,

² ' with his last breath exhorting and instruffing his sons to atchieve the

conquest of the Chinese empire.
The haram of Zingis was composed of five hundred wiyes and

concubines; and of this numerous progeny, four sons, illustrious by
