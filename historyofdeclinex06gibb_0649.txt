use of baths ³² and porticoes was forgotten: in the sixth century, the C {³303 P.
games of the theatre, amphitheatre, and circus, had been inter· ι-Ὺῇα
rupted: some temples were devoted to the prevailing worship; but
the Christian churches preferred the holy figure of the cross3 and
faffiion, or reason, had distributed after a peculiat- model the cells

aud offices of the cloyster. Under the ecclefiastical reign, the num-

city was crowded with forty monasteries of men, twenty of women,
and fixty chaptc ς and colleges of canons and priests ³³, who aggra-
vated, instead of reheving, the depopulation of the tenth century.
But if the forms of ancient architeffiire were disregarded by a people
insenfible of their use and beauty, the plentiful materials were ap-
plied to every call of neceffity or superstition3 till the fai-rest columns
of the Ionic and Corinthiam orders, the richest marbles off Paros and
Numidia, were degraded, perhaps to the support of a convent or a
stable. The daily havock which is perpetrated by the Turks in the

howsoever mangled or profaned, may be vievved with pleasure and
regret3 but the greater part of the marble was deprived of substance,
as well as of place and proporti0n3 it was burnt to lime for the
purpose of cernent. Since the arrival of Poggius, the temple of
Concord ³⁵, and many capital strufiures, had vanilhed from his eyes ς
