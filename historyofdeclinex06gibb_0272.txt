THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. not the nation, was changed, by the marriage of an heiress, into the

LXII.

cmv-..a elder branch of the house of Briennc. The son of that marriage,

&Valter de Brienne, succeeded ·t0 the dutchy of Athens; and, with
the aid of some Catalan mercenaries, whom he invested with fiefs,
reduced above thirty castles of the vaffal or neighbouring lords. But
when he was informed of the approach and ambition of the great
company, he collected a force of seven hundred knights, fix thou-
sand four hundred horse, and eight thousand foot, and boldly met
them on the banks of the river Cephisus in Boeotia. The Catalans
amounted to -no more than three thousand five hundred horse, and
four thousand footz but the deficiency of numbers was compensated

by stratagem and order. They formed round their camp an artificial
inundation: the duke and his knights advanced without sear or pre-

caution on the verdant meadow z their horses plunged into the b0g3
and he was cut in picces‚ with the greatest part of the French ca-
valry. His family and nation were expelled ; and his son Walter
2de Brienne, the titular duke of Athens, the tyrant of Florence, and
2the constable of France, lost his life in the field of Poitiers. Attica
*and Boeotia were the rewards of the vietorious Catalans: they mar-
,ried the widows and daughters of the ssain; and during fourteen
years, the great company was the terror of the Grecian states. Their
fa&ions drove them to acknowledge the sovereignty of the house of
Arragon3 and during t-he remainder of the fourteenth century,
Athens, as a government or an appanage, was succeffively bestowed
by the kings of Sicily. After the French and Catalans‚ the third ἢ
dynasty was that of the Accaioli, a family, plebeian at Florence‚ ς
potent at Naples‚ and sovereign in Greece. Athens, which they

flembellished with new buildings, became the capital of a state, that
emended over Thebes, Argos, Corinth, Delphi, and a part of Thes-

saly; and their reign was finally determined by Mahomet the second,
‹who straugled the last duke, and educated his sons in the discipline
and ,religion of the seraglio.
