OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

31¹

At the head, or in the rear, of a Carizmian army, Soliman Shah was C H Α P,

drowned in the passage of the Euphrates: his son Orthogrul became the
soldier and subject of Aladin, and established at Surgut, on the banks
of the Sangar, acamp of four hundred families or tenta, whom he
governed fifty-two years both in peace and war. He was the father of
Thaman, or Affiman, whose Turkish name has been melted into the
appellation of the caliph Othman3 and if we describe that pastoral
chief as a {hepherd and a robber, we must separate from those chamoers
all idea of ignominy and baseness. Othman poffeffed, and perhaps
- surpaffed, the ordinary virtues of a soldier3 and the circumstances
of time and place were propitious to his independence and success.
The Seljukian dynasty was no more; and the distance and decline
of the Mogul khans soon enfranchised him from the control of a
superior. He was fituate on the verge of the Greek empire: the
Koran sancrified his gazi, or holy war, against the infidels; and
their political errors unlocked the paffes of mount Olympus, and in-
vited him to descend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of
Palaeologus, these passes had been vigilantly guarded by the militia
of the country, who were repaid by their own safety and an ex-
emption from taxes. The emperor abolished their privilege and
affumed their office3 but the tribute was rigoroussy collected, the
custody of the paffes was neglected. and the hardy mountaineers¹

degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants without spirit or·

discipline. It was on the twenty—seventh of July,in the yeartwelve·
hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian aera, that Othman first,

hereditary troops were multiplied in each campaign by the acceffion.
