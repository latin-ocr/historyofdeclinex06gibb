in the rude idiom of his age and country ³², to write or (liciate ³³ an
original narrative of the councils and actions, in which he bore a
memorable part. At the same time, Baldwin count os Flanders,
who had married the sister of Thibaut, assumed the cross at Bruges,
with his brother Henry and the principal knights and citizens of that

toils and perils of a land expedition3 and, if the Flemings dwelt
