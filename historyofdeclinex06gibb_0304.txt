tians, with their allies the Catalans, had the advantage of number3 and ,
their fleet, with the poor addition of eight Byzantine gallies, amounted ⁵
to seventy-five sail: the Genoese did not exceed fixty-four3-but in
those times their ships of war were distinguished by the superiority
of their fize and strength. The names and families of their naval
commandere, Pisani and Doria, are illustrious in the annals of theIr

-country ; but the personal merit of the former was eclipsed by the

fame and abilities of his rival. They engaged in tempestuous wea-

vther3 and the tumultuary confiist was continued from the dawn to

the extinction of light. The enemies of the Genoese applaud their

⁴prowess: the friends of the Venetians are diffatisfied with their

behaviour3 but all parties agree in praismg the skill and boldness' of
the Catalans, who, with many wounds, sustained the brunt of the
aetion. On the separation of the fleets, the event might appear
doubtful ; but the thirteen Genoese gallies, that had been sunk or

taken, were compensated by a double loss of the allies3 of fourteen
Venetiam, ten Catalans, and two Greeks ; and even the grief of the
conquerors expreffed the affurance and habit of more decisive vic-
tories. Pisani confeffed his defeat, by retiring into a fortified har·-
bour, from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate,
lie steered with a broken and flying squadron for the isse of Candia,
and abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a public
epistle, addreffed to the doge and senate, Petrarch employs his elo-
quence to reconcile the maritime powers, the two luminaries of Italy.
