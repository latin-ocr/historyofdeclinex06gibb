tagenet was impatient to punish a perfidious rival who had invaded ⁸——v-——1

Normandy in his absence; and the indefatigable sultan was subdued
by the eries of the people‚ who was the viffim, and of the soldiers,
who were the instruments, of his martial zeal. The first demands
of the king of England were the restitution of Jerusalem, Palestine,

v and the true cross3 and he firmly declared, that himself and his

brother pilgrims would end their lives in the pious labour, rather
than return to Europe with ignominy and remorse. But the con·
science of Saladin refused, without some weighty compensation‚ to
restore the idols‚ or promote the idolatry, of the Christians: he as-
serted, with equal firmness‚ his religious and civil claim to the so-
vereignty of Palestine 3 descanted on the importance and sanetity
of jerusalem3 and rejected all terms of the establishment, or par-
tition‚ of the Latins. The marriage which Richard proposed, of
his sister with the sultan’s brother, was defeated by the difference of
faith: the princess abhorred the embraces of a Turk ς and Adel, ot
Saphadin‚ would not easily renounce a plurality of wives. A per-
sonal interview was declined by Saladin, who alleged their mutual
ignorance of each other's language; and the negociation was ma-
naged with much art and delay by their interpreters and envoys.
The final agreement was equally disapproved by the zealots of both
parties, by the Roman pontiff and the caliph of Bagdad. It was
stipulated that Jerusalem and the holy sepulchre should be open,
without tribute or vexation, to the pilgrimage of the Latin Chris-
tians; that, after the demolition of Ascalon, they should inclusively
possess the sea-coast from Jaffa to Tyre; that the count of Tripoli
and the prince of Antioch should be comprised in the truce3 and
that, during three years and three months, all hostilities should cease.
The principal chiefs of the two armies swore to the observance of

the treaty3 but the monarchs were satisfied with giving their word
and their right-hand3 and the royal majesty was excused from an

oath, which always implies some suspicion of falsehood and disho-
