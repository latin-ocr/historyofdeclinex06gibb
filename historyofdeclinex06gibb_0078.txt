50 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 15}ssst P. was cut down: the necessary timber was transported to the camp
§.zv—‘1 by the vigour and dexterity of Tancred3 and the engines were
framed by some Genoese artists‚ who had fortunately lauded in the
harbour of Jaffa. Two moveable turrets were construGted at the
expence, and in the stations, of the duke of Lori-aine and the count
of Tholouse, and rolled forwards with devout labour‚ not to the
most acceffible, but to the most neglected‚ parts of the fortification.
Raymond's tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged,
but his colleague was more vigilant and successfu13 the enemies were
driven by his archers from the rampart3 the draw-bridge was let
down 3 and on a Friday at three in the afternoon, the day and hour
of the Paffion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood vicZ'corious on the walls of
Jerusalem. His example was followed on every fide by the emulation
of valour3 and about four hundred and fixty years after the conquest
of Omar‚ the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan yoke. In the
pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had agreed to
respe& the exclusive property of the first occupant 3 and the spoils
of the great mosch, seventy lamps ,and maffy vases of gold and
filver, rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generofity, of Tan-
cred. A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the
God of the Christians: refistance might provoke‚ but neither age.
nor sex could mollffy, their implacable rage: they indulged them-
selves three days in a promiscuous maffacre ¹¹⁰3 and the infeffron of
the dead bodies produced an epidemical disease. , After severity thou-
sand Mossems had been put to the sword‚ and the harmless Jews
had been burnt in their synagogue, they could still reserve a multi-
tude of captives, whom interest or laffitude persuaded them to spare-
Of these savage heroes of the cro-ss, Tancred alone betrayed some
sentiments of compaffion 3 yet we may praise the more selsiss1 lenity
of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe condust to the
