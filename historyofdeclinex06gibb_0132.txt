his throne to seek the adventures of a spiritual knight-errant. A
monkish historian would have been content to applaud the most
despicable part of his character3 but the noble and gallant Joinville⁹⁴,
who shared the friendship and captivity of Louis, has traced with
the pencil of nature the free portrait of his virtues as well as of his
failings. From this intimate knowledge, we may learn to suspedl:
the political views of depreffing their great vaffals, which are so
often imputed to the royal authors of the crusades. Above all the
princes of the middle ages, Louis the ninth successfully laboured to
restore the prerogatives of the crown ; but it was at home, and not
in the East, that he acquired for himself and his posterity ; his vow
was the result of enthufiasm and fickness3 and if he were the pro-
moter, he was likewise the vistim, of this holy madness. For the
invasion of Egypt, Franee was exhausted of her troops and trea-
sures; he covered the sea of Cyprus with eighteen hundred sail33 the
most modest enumeration amounts to fifty thousand men3 and, if we
might trust his own confession, as it is reported by Oriental vanity,
he disembarked nine thousand five hundred horse, and one hundred

and thirty thousand foot, who performed their pilgrimage under the
