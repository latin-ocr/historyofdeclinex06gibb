THE DECLINE AND FALL

with gifts and honours, Manuel returned to Paris; and, after a re-
sidenee of two' years in the West, ssiaped his course through Ger-
many and Italy, embarked at Venice, and patiently expeeted, in
the Mol-ea, the moment of his ruin or deliverance. Yet he had
eseaped the ignominious neceffity of offering his religion to public
or private sule. The Latin church was distraeted by the great
schism: the kings, the nations, the univerfities‚ of Europe, were
divided in their obedience between the popes of Rome and Avign0n3
and the emperor, anxious to conciliate the friendship of both parties,
abstained from any correspondence With the indigent and unpopular
rivale. His journey coincided with the year of the jubilee3 but he
paffed through Italy without defiring, or deserving, the plenary in-
dulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the fins of the
faithful. The Roman pope was offended by this negle&; accused
him of irreverenee to an image of Christ ; and exhorted the princes
of Italy to rejeet and abandon the obstinate schismatie ²¹. .
