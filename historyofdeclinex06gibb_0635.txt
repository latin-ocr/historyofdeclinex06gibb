⁹⁵ A wandering Italian, Gregorio Leti,
has given the Vita di Sisto-Qinto (Am-
stel. 1721, 3 vols. in 12¹⁷¹⁰)‚ a copious and
amusing work, but which does not corn-
mand our absolute confidence. Yet the
character of' the man, and the principa!
facts, are supported by the Annals of Spon-
danus and Muratori (A. D. 1585—1590),
and the contemporary history of the great
Thuauus (l. lxxxii. c. 1, 2. l. lxxxiv. c. 10.
l. c. c. 8.).

⁹⁶ These privileged places, the quartieri

or franchifir, were adopted from the Roman
nobles by the foreign ministers. Julius ΙΙ.
had once abolished the abominandum et de-
testandum franchitiarum hujusmodi nomen;
and after Sixtus V. they again revived. I
cannot discern either the justice or magna-
nimity of Louis XIV. who in 1687 sent
his ambaffador, the marquis de Lavardin,

⁹⁷ This outrage produced a decree, which
was inscribed on marb1e‚ and placed in the
Capitol. It is expreffed in a style of manly
fimplicity and freedom : Si quis, five priva-
tus, five magistratum gerens de collocanda

monarch who deserves a statue, should himself
