OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the fixteenth century. While the Roman· edifices were still entire,
the first blows, however weighty and impetuous, were resisted by
the solidity of the mass and the harmony of parts, but the ssightest
touch would precipitate the fragments of arches and columns, that
already nodded to their fall.

After a diligent enquiry, I can discern four principal causes of the
ruin of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more
than a thousand years. Ι. The injuries of time and nature. II. The
hostile attacks of the Barbarians and Christians. ΙΙΙ. The use and
abuse of the materials. And, IV. The domestic quarrels of the
Romans.

Ι. The art of man i's able to construet monuments far more per-
manent than the narrow span of his own existence: yet these mo-
numents, like himself, are perishable and frail ς· and in the bound-
Iess annals of time, his life and hi's labours must· equally be measured
as a fl'eeting moment. Of a fimple and solid edifice‚ it is not easy
however to circumscribe the duration. As the wonders of ancient
days, the pyramids⁹ attracted the curiosity of the ancients: an hun=
dred· generations, the leaves of autumn¹⁰‚ have d1·opt into the grave 3
and after the fall of the Pharaohs and Ptolemies‚ the Caesars and
cali'phs, the same pyramids stand ere& and unshaken above the
floods of the Nile. A complex figure of various and minute parts
is more acceffible to injury and decay3 and the filent lapse-of time
is often accelerated by hurricanes and· earthquakes, by fires and in-
undations. The air and earth have doubtless been ffiaken ; and
the lofty turrets of Rome have tottered from. their foundations: but

the seven hills do not appear tov be placed on the great cavities of the
globe3 nor has the city, in any age, been exposed to the convul-v

⁹ The age of the pyramids is remote and dynasties would fix them about 2000 years
unknown, fince Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. before Christ (Canon. Chmnicus, p. 47.).
