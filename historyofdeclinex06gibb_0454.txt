inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were
transportet] from the most remote stiores of Europe and Asia3 and
the public and private buildings, the palaces, churches‚ aqueduc‘ts,
cisterns, porticoes, columns, baths, and hippodromes, were adapted
to the greatness of the capital of the East. The superfluity of
wealth was spread along the shores of Europe and Asia>3 and t'he
Byzantine territory, as far as the Euxine, the Hellespont, and the
long wall, might be confidered as a populous suburb and a perpe-
tual garden. In this flattering picture, the past and the present, the
times of prosperity and decay, are artsully confounded3 but a figh
and a confeffion escape from the orator, that his wretched country
was the (hadow and sepulchre of its former self. The works of
ancient sculpture had been defaced by Christian zeal or Barbarie
violence3 the fairest structures were detnoliffied3 and the marbles
of Paros or Numidia were burnt for lime, or applied to the meanest “
uses. Of many a statue, the place was marked by an empty pe-
destal; of many a column, the fize was determined by a broken
capital; the tombs of the emperors were scattered on the ground 3
the stroke of time was accelerated by storms and earthquakes; and
the vacant space was adorned, by vulgar tradition, with fabulous
monuments of gold and filver. From these wonders, which lived
only in memory or belief, he distinguishes however the porphyry
pillar, the column and colossus of Justinian ³, and the church, more
especially the dome, of St. Sophia; the best conclusion, since it
could not be described according to its merits, and after it no other
object could deserve to be mentioned. But he forgetS, that a

colossus of justinian (l. vii. 12.) : but his the column, but in the outward court of the
