life were exposed to their familiar observation 3 and proximity must
diminilh the reverence, which his name and his deerees impressed
on a barbarous world. This differenee has not escaped the notice of
our philosophie historian z “ Though the name and authority of the
“ court of Rome were so terrible in the remote countries of Europe,
‘⁴ which were sunl< in profound ignorance, and were entirely unae-
“ quainted with its character and conduct, the pope was so little
“ revered at home, that his inveterate enemies surrounded the gates
“ of Rome itself‚ and even controlled his government in that city;
“ and the ambassadors, who, from a distant extremity of Europe,
“ carried to h‘rm the* humble, or rather abjeci, submiffi-ons of the
“ greatest potentate of the age, found the utmost difficulty to—make
“ their way to him, and to throw themselves at his feet ¹¹.'’

envy, their power to⁴ opposition, and their persons to violence.
But the long hostility of the mitre and the crown encreased the
numbers, and inflamed the paffions, of their enemies. The deadly
fastions of the G-uelphs and Ghibelines, so fatal to Italy, could never
be embraced with truth or constaney by the Romans, the subjecte·
and adversaries both of the bilhop and emperor·; but their support
was solicited by both parties; and they alternately displayed inv their
banners the keys of St. Peter and the German eagle. Gregory the

monarchy, was driven from Rome, and died in exile att Salerno0-
