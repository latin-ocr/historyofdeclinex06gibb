invested with his sword and spurs ; and his cheek or shoulder were
touched with a ssight blow, as an emblem of the last affront, which it
was lawful for him to endure. But superstition mingled in every public
and private aClion of life3 in the holy wars, it sandiified the profeflion
of arms 3 and the order of chivalry was affimilated in its rights and
privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The bath and white
garment of the novice, were an indecent copy of the regeneration of
baptism: his sword, which he offered on the altar, was bleffed by the
ministers of religion3 his solemn reception was preceded by fasts and
vigils ; and he was created a knight in the name of God, of St.
George, and os St. Michael the archangel. He swore to accomplish

the duties of his profeflion 3 and education, example, and the public
opinion, were the inviolable guardians of his oath. As the champion

of God and the ladies (1 blush to unite such discordant names), he
devoted himself to speak the truth ; to maintain the right3 to protest
the distreffed ; to pradiise courtesy‚ a virtue less familiar to the ancients;
to pursue the infidels 3 to despise the allurements of ease and safety;
and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honour of his cha-
racter. The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight
to disdain the arts of industry and peace 3 to esteem himself the sole
judge and avenger of his own injuries; and proudly to neglect the
laws of civil society and military discipline. Yet the benefits of this
institution, to refine the temper of Barbarians, and to infuse some

principles, of faith, justice, and humansty, were strongly felt, and
have been often observed. The asperity of national prejudice was
softened3 and the community of religion and arms spread a fimilar
colour and genereus emulation over the face of Christendom.
