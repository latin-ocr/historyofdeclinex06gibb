OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

I have not undertaken the ccclefiastical history of the schis1n3 but
Rome, the object of these last chapters, is deeply intercsted in the
disputed succeffion of her sovereigns. The first counsels sor the
peace and union of Christendom arose from the university of Paris,
from the faculty of the Sorbonne, whose doctors were esteemed‚ at

theological science ⁷². Prudently waving all invidious enquiry into
the origin and merits of the dispute‚ they proposed, as an healing
