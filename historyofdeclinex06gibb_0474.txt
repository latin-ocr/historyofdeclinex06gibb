4356 THE ‘DECLxNE ΛΝΒ FALL

C {J ᾖ rheu-ard had cemented the mutual hond of the sultan and his subject.
nai-L Π Seanderbeg had long harboured the belief of Christianity and the
intention of revolt, a worthy mind must condemn the base diffi-
mulation, that could serve only to betray‚ that could promise only
to be foresworn, that could adtively join in the temporal and spiri-
tual perdition of so many thousands of his unhappy brethren. Shall

garrisons were indulged in the *choice of martyrdom or baptism. In
the affembly of the states of Epirus, Scanderbeg was eleeted general
of the Turkish war ; and each of the allies engaged to furnisti his
respective proportior] of men and money. From these contributions,
from his patrimonial estate, and from the valuable salt-pits of Selina,
he drew an annual revenue of two hundred thousand ducats ³⁹3 and
the entire sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly
appropriated to the public use. His manners were popular3 but his
