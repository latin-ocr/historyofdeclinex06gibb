homet, the eity which she had formerly saved from Chosrocs and μανψ

the Chagan. In the double intoxication of zeal and wine, they va-
liantly exclairned, “ What occafion have we for succour, or union,
“ or Latius? far from us be the worship of the Azymites !'’ During
the winter that preceded the Turkish conquest, the nation was dis-
traCted by this epidemical frenzy3 and the season of Lent, the ap-
proach of Easter, instead of breathing charity and love, served only
to fortify the obstinacy and influence of the zealots. The confessors
scrutinised and alarmed the conscience of their votaries, and a rigor-
ous penance was imposed on those, who had received the com-
munion from a priest, who had given an express or tacit consent to
the union. His service at the altar propagated the infection to the
mute and fitnple speetators of the ceremony: they forfeited, by the
impure sprxstacIe, the virtue of the sacerdotal charaeter3 nor was it
lawful, even in danger of sudden death, to invoke the affistance of
their prayers or absolution. No sooner had the church of St. Sophia
been polluted by the Latin sacrifice, than it was desei-ted as a Jewish
synagogue‚ or an heathen temple, by the clergy and people: and a
vast and gloomy filence prevailed in that venerable dome, which
had so often smoked with a cloud of incense, blazed with innume-
rable lights‚ and resounded with the voice of prayer and thanksgiving.
The Latins were the most odious of heretics and infidels3 and the
first minister of the empire, the great duke‚ was heard to declare,
that he had rather behold in Constantinople the turban of Mahomet,
than the pope’s tiara or a cardinal's hat³‘. A sentiment so unworthy
of Christians and patriots‚ was familiar and fatal to the“Greeks ε the
emperor was deprived of the affection and support of his subjeetsg
and their native cowardice was sanetified by resignation to the divine
decree, or the vifionary hope of a miraculous deliverance.
