OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and to chastise the oppressore, of mankind 3 that they wished to burn C H A Ρ·

the records of claffie literature, and to found their national archi-
te&ure on the broken members of the Tuscan and Corinthian
orders. But in {imple tuith, the northern conquerors were neither
sufficiently savage, nor sufficiently refined, to entertain such aspiring
ideas of destruffion and revenge. The shepherds of Scythia and
Germany had been edueated in the armies of the empire, whose
discipline they acquired, and whose weakness they invaded: with
the familiar use of the Latin tongue‚ they had learned to reverence
the name and titles of Rome3 and, though incapable of emulating‚
they were more inclined to admire, than to abolish, the arts and
studies of a brighter period. In the tranfient posseffion of a rich
and unrefisting capital, the soldiers of Alarie and Genseric were sti-
mulated by the paffions of a vietorious army; amidst the wanton
indulgence of lust or cruehy, portable wealth was the objeo: of
their search; nor could they derive either pride or pleasnre from the
unprofitable reflee‘tion,that they had battered to the ground the works
of the consuls and Caesars. Their moments were indeed precions;
the Goths evacuated Rome onv the fixth ²¹, the Vandals on the
fifteenth‚ day ²² 3 and, though it be far more difficult to build than
to destroy, their hasty affault would have made a ssight impreflion
on the solid piles of antiquity. &Vc may remember, that both Alaric
and Censet-ic affeeted to spare the buildings of the city3 that they

subsisted in strength and beauty under the auspicious government of

Theodoric² 3 and that the momentary resentment of Totila ²⁴ was
disarmed by his own temper and the advice of his friends and ene-
mies. From these innocent Barbarians, the reproach may be trans-

ferred to the Catholics of Rome. The statues, altars, and houses, of
