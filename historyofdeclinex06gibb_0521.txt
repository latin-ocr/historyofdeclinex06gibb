recovered his freedom; in the cnsuing winter he ventured to Adria- n--w—-s

nople, and ransomed his wife from the mir brgfhi or master of the
horse ; but his two children, in the fiower of youth and beauty‚ had
been seized for the use of Mahomet himself. The daughter of
Phranza died in the seraglio, perhaps a virgin : his son, in the fifteenth
year os his age, preferred death to iufamy, and was stabbed by the

hand of the royal lover⁶⁶. A deed thus inhuman, cannot surely be
expiated by the taste and liberality with which he released a Grecian
matron, and her two daughters, on receiving a Latin ode from Phi-
lelphus, who had chosen a wife in that noble family⁶⁷. The pride
or cruelty of Nlahornet would have been most sensibly gratified by
the capture of a Roman legate3 but the dexterity of cardinal Isidore
eluded the search, and he escaped from Galata in a plebeian habit⁶⁵.
The chain and entrance of the outward harbour was still occupied
by the Italian ships of merchandise and war. They had fignalised
theirvalour in the fiege3 they embmeed the moment of retreat,
while the Turkish mariners were diffipated in the pillage of the
city. XVhen they hoisted sail, the beach was covered with a sup-
pliant and lamentable crowd: but the means of transportation were
scanty: the Venetians and Genoese seleoed their countryrnen ; and,
notwithstanding the fairest promises of the sultam, the inhabitants of
Galata evacuated their houses, and embarked with their most preci-
ous effeets,

corrupt and inhuman of tyrantff.

Yet he could only leam from repert, the
bloody or impure scenes that were afted in

that he crafzily placed his cardinal’s hat on
the head of a corpse which was cut off and.
exposed in triumph, while the legate himself

was bought and delivered, as a captive of no η

the dark receffes ofthe seraglio.

Lancelot (Mem. de I’Aeademie des Inscrip-
tiens, tom. x. p.718.). 1 should be curious to
Iearn how he could praise the public ene-
my, whom he so often reviles as the most

value. The great Belgic Chronicle adorns
his escape with new adventures, which he
suppreffrd (says spondanus, A. D. 1453,
ΝΟ 15.) in his own letters, lest he should lose
the merit and reward of suffering for Christ.
