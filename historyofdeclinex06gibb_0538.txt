520 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. distance from the city, their approach was saluted by a long pro-
ἐξ ceffion of the clergy and people with palms and crosses; and the
terrific emblems of wolves and lions, of dragous and eagles, that
fioated in the military banners, represented the departed legions and

cohorts of the republic. The royal oath to maintain the liberties of

Rome was thrice reiterated, at the bridge, the gate, and on the stairs
of the Vatican ; and the distribution of a customary donative feebly
imitated the magnificence of the first Caesars. In the church of St.
Peter, the coronation was performed by his successor: the voice of
God was confounded with that of the people; and the public con-
sent was declared in the acclamations of, “ Long life and vic‘tory to
“ our lord the pope! Long life and viu-Story to our lord the em-
“ peror ! Long life and victory to the Roman and Teutonic
“ armies ⁴ !'' The names of Caesar and Augustus, the laws of Con-
stantine and Justinian, the example of Charlemagne and Otho, esta-
bliffied the supreme dominion of the emperors3 their title and
image was engraved on the papal coins ⁵ ; and their jurisdiffi'tion was
marked by the sword of justice, which they delivered to the praefe&
of the city. But every Roman prejudice was awakened by the
name, the language‚ and the manners, of a Barbarian lord. The Cae-
sars of Saxony or Franconia were the chiefs of a feudal aristocracy3
nor could they exercise the discipline of civil and military power,
which alone secures ¹the obedience of a distant people, impatient of
servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom. Once, and once
only, in his life, each emperor, with an army of Teutonic vaffals,

is best represented from the original monu-
ments by Muratori (Antiquitat. Italia: medii
AEvi‚ tom. i. dissertat. ii. p. 99, &c.)‚ and
Cenni (Monument. Domin. Pontis. tom. ii.
diff. vi. p. 261), the latter of whom Ionly
know from the copious extra& os Schmidt

(Hist. des Allemands, tom. iii. p. 255—
266.).

was no more than magni nominis umbra.

⁵ Muratori has given the serres of the papal
coins (Antiquitat. tom. ii. diss. xxvii. p.548
-55‘4.). He finds only two more early
than the year 800: fifty are still extant from
Leo ΙΙΙ. to Leo IX. with addition of the
reigning emperor; none remain of· Gre-
gory VlI. or Urban 11.'; but in those of
Paschal 11. he seems to have renounced this
badge of dependente.
