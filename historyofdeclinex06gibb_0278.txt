First disputes
between the
elder and
younger An-
dronicus,

A. D. 1320.

THE ‘DECLINE AND FALL

he displays the sniooth and specious furface of events, highly var-
nilhed with his own praises and those of his friends. Their motives
are always pure3 their ends always legitimate : they conspire and rebel
without any views of interest3 and the violence which they infliec
or suffer is celebrated as the spontaneous esse& of reason and virtue.
After the example of the first of the Palaeologi‚ the elder Andro.-
nieus associated his son NIichael to the honours of the purple; and
from the age of eighteen to his premature death, that prince was
acknowledged, above twenty-five years, as the second emperor of
the Greeks ⁶. At the head of an army, he ‘excited neither the fears
of the enemy nor the jealousy of the court: his modesty and pa-
tience were never tempted to compute the years of his father3 nor
was that father compelled to repent of his liberality either by ‘the
virtues or vices of his son. The son of Michael was named An-
dronicus from his grandfather, to whose early favour he was intro-
duced by that nominal resemblance. The bloffoms of wit and
beauty encreased the fondness of the elder Andronicus; and, with
the common vanity of age, he expected to realize in the second, the
hope which had been disappointed in the first, generation. The boy
was educated in the palace as an heir and a favourite3 and, in th'e
oaths and acclamations of the people, the czuglst triad was formed
by the names of the father, the son, and the grandson. But the
younger Andronicus was speedily corrupted by his infant greatness,
while he beheld with· puerile impatience the double obstacle that,
hung, and might long hang, over his rising ambition. It was not tor
acquire fame, or to diffuse happiness, that he so eagerly aspired:
wealth and impunity were in his eyes the most precious attributes
of a monarch3 and his first indiscreet demand was the sovereignty ’
