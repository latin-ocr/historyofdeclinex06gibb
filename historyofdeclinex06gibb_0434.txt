THE DECLINE AND FALL

‘⁶ of Athens ; and the style of their writ'mgs is still more elaborate
“ and correct. The persons who, by their birth and offices, are
‘⁶ attached to the Byzantine court, are those who maintain‚ with
“ the least alloy, the ancient standard of elegauce and purity3 and
“ the native graces of language most conspicuoussy ihine among the
“ noble matrons, who are excluded from all intercourse with fo·-
reigners. With foreigners do Ι say? They live retired and se-
“ questered from the eyes of their fellow-citizens. Seldom are they
“ seen in the streets 3 and when they leave their houses, it is in the
“ dusk of evening, on visits to the ehurches and their nearest kin-
“ dred. On these occasions, they are on horseback, covered with a
“ veil‚ and encompaffed by their parents, their huffiands, or their
“ servants ‘³²3'

Among the Greeks, a numerous and opulent clergy was dedicated
to the service of religion: their monks and biffiops have ever been'
distinguished by the gravity and austerity of their manners3 nor
‘were they diverted, like the Latin priests, by the pursuits and plea-
sures of a secular, and even military, life. After a large deductiori
for the time and talents that were lost in the devotion, the laziness,
and the discord, of the church and cloyster, the more inquisitive and
ambitious minds would explore the sacred and profane erudition of
their native language. The ecclefiastics prefided over the education
of youth ; the schools of philosophy and eloquence vvere perpetuated
till the fall of the empIre .; and it may be affirmed, that more books and
more knowledge were included within the walls of Constantinople than
could be dispersed over the extensive countries of the West ²³³. But
an important distinction has been already noticed: the Greeks were
stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing witlLa
rapid and progreffive motion. The nations were excited by the

⁵² philelphus, absurdly enough, derives xiv¹¹¹ centuries, in the learned and judicious

this Greek or Oriental jealousy from the Mofheim (Institut. Hist. Eccles. p. 434-
mannezs of ancient Rome. 440. 490—494.).
