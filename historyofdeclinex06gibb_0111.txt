most humble of his ssaves ; and the indiscreet murmurs of the divan
were filenced by the prudent Ayub, who loudly protested that at
the command of the sultan he himself would lead his son in chains
to the foot of the throne. “ Such language‚” he added in private,
“ was prudent and proper in an affembly of your rivals; but vve

death relieved thern from the odious and doubtful conflict: his son, a
minor of eleven years of age, was left for a while to the emirs of
Damascus3 and the new lord of Egypt was decorated by the caliph
with every title ξ’ that could sanaify his usurpation in the eyes of the

regions of Yemen, or the happy Arabia3 and at the hour of his
death, his empire was spread from the African Tripoli to the Tigris,
and from the [ndian ocean to the mountains of Armenia. In the
judgment of his charadier, the reproaches of treason and ingratitude
strike forcibly on our minds, impreffid, as they are, with the prin-
ciple and experience of law and loyalty. But his ambition may
in some measure be excused by the revolutions of Afia ⁵², which had
erased every notion of legitimate succeffion ; by the recent example
of the Atabeks themselves; by his reverence to the son of his be·-
