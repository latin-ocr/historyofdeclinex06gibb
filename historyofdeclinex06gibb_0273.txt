oF THE ROMAN» EMPIRE.

Athens ⁵⁶, though no more than the shadow of her former self,
still contains about eight or ten thousand inhabitants: of these, three-
fourths are Greeks in religion and language5 and the Turks, who
compose the remainder, have relaxed, in their intercourse with the
citizens, somewhat of the pride and gravity of their national cha-
raster. The olive—tree, the gift of Minerva, flourilhes in Attica ;
nor has the honey of mount Hymettus 10st any part of its exquisite
flavour⁵⁷: but the languid trade is monopolised by strangers 3 and·
the agriculture of a barren land is abandoned to the vagrant Wala-

chians. The Athenians are still distinguished by the subtlety and

acuteness of their understandings :but these qualities, unless ennobled»
by freedom and enlightened by study, will degenerate into a low and-
selfish cunning: and itis a proverbial saying of the country, ‘⁴ From«

the tyranny of the Turkiffi bafflaws‚ by an expedient which alle--
viates their servitude and aggravates their lhame. About the middle‘

of the last century, the Athenians chose for their protector the Kissarf

who poffesses the sultan's ear, condescends to accept the tribute of
thirty thousand crowns: his lieutenant, the Waywode‚ whom he
annually confirms, may reserve for his own about five or fix thou-

fail '‘to remove and punish an oppreflive governor.. Their private>

⁵⁶ The modern account of Athens, and the
Athenians,-is extrasted from Spon (Voyage en
Grece, tom. ii. p. 79—199.) and Wheeler
(Travels into Greece, p. 337—414.), Stuart
(Antiquities of Athens, paffim) and Chandler
(Travels into Gracc, p. 23—172.). The first
of these travellers vifited Greece in the year
¹⁶76» the last 17653 and ninety years had not

produced much difference in the tranquil scene.
⁵⁷ The ancients‚ or at least the Armeniam,

believed that all the bees in the world had-

been propagated from mount Hymettus.

They taught, that health might be preserved„
and life prolonged, by the extet-nal use of 051„
and the internal use of honey (Geoponica‚.
