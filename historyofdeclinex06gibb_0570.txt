to a scanty allowanee of bread, water, and wine. During the va-
cancy of the holy see, the cardinals are prohibited from touching
the revennes, or affuming, unless in some rare emergency, the go-
vernment‚ of the chureh: all agreements and promises among the
eleetors are formally annulled; and their integrity is fortified by
their solemn oath and the prayers of the Catholics. Some articles of
inconvenient or superfluous rigour have been gradually relaxed, but
the principle of confinement is vigorous and entire: they are still
urged, by the personal motives of health and freedom, to accelerate
the moment of their deliverzg1ce3 and the improvement of ballot
or secret votes has wrapt thestruggles of the conclave ⁷¹ in the filky

veil of charity and politeness ⁷². By these institutions, the Romans

were exeluded from the eleffion of their pr'mee ancl bishop3 and in
the fever of wild and precarious liberty, they seemed insenfible of
the loss of this inestimable privilege.> The emperor Lewis of Ba-

appreciate the knowledge or authority of an
anonymous Italian, whose history (Conclavi
de' Pontifici Romani, in 4¹0, 1067) has been
continued fince the reign &Alexander VII.
The accidental form cf the work furnishes a
leffon, though not an anxit-low, to ambition.
From a labyrinth of iuuignes, we emerge to
the adoration of the successful candidate: but
the next page opens with his funeral.

⁷² The expreffions of cardinal de Retz are
posxtive and picluresque: On y vegut toujours
ensemble avec le meme respeSt, et la meme

civilite que I’on observe dans le cabinet des
rois, avec la meme politeffe qu’on avoit dans
la cour de Henri ΙΙΙ. avec la mEme *familia-
rite que l’on voit dans les colleges; avec la

noviciat53 et avec la meme charite, du moins
en apparence, qui pourroit &tre entre des
freres parfaitement unis.

too imperfect to pronounce, how much of this
constitution was temporary, and how much
ordinary and permanent. Yet it is faintly '11-
lustrated by the ancient statutes of Rome.
