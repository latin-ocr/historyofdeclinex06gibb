was not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the de-
mandant3 but he was obliged to produce witneffes who had, 01·
affumed to have, knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the
privilege of the defendant ; because he charged the witness with an

attempt by perjury to take away his right. He came therefore to be in
the same fituation as the appellant in criminal cases. It was not then
as a mode of proof that the combat was received, nor as making
negative evidence (according to the suppofition of Montesquieu ¹³⁹) ;
but in every case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to-
pursue by arms the redress of an injury ; and the judicial combat
was fought on the same principle, and with the same spirit, as a
private duel. Champions were only allowed to women, and to men
maimed or past the age of fixty. The consequence of a defeat was*
death to the person aecused, or to the champion or witness, as well
as to the accuser himself ; but in civil. cases, the demandant was
punissied with infamy and the loss of his suit, while his witness and
champion suffered an ignominious death. In many cases it was in
the option of the judge to award or to refuse the combat: but two
