THE DECLINE AND FALL

nour. Richard embarked for Europe to feel< a long captivity and
a prematurc grave3 and the space of a few months concluded the
life and glories of Saladin. The Orientale describe his edifying
death, which happened at Damascus3 but they seem ignorant of the
equal distribution of his alms among the three religions ⁵¹, or of the
display of a ssirond, instead of a standard, to admonifh the East of

‘the instability of human greatness. The unity of empire was dis-

solved by his death3 his sons were oppreffed by the stronger arm of
their uncle Saphadin; the hostile interests of the sultans of Egypt, ν
Damascus, and Aleppo⁸²‚ were again revived3 and the Franks or
Latins stood, and breathed, and hoped, in their fortreffes along the
Syrian coast.

The nobIest monument of a conqueror-'s fame, and of the terror
which he inspired, is the Saladine tenth, a general tax, Which was
imposed on the laity‚ and even the clergy‚ of the Latin church for
the service of the holy war. The practice was too lucrative to ex-
pire with the occafi0n3 and this tribute became the foundation of
all the tithes and tenths on ecclesiastica] benefices‚ which have been
granted by the Roman pontiffs to Catholic sovereigns, or reservet}
for the immediate use of the apostolic see ²³³. This pecuniary emo-
lument must have tended to encrease the interest of the popes in the
recovery of Palestine3 after the death of Saladin they preached the
crusade, by their epistles, their legateS‚ and their miffionaries; and
the accomplishment of the pious work might have been expeeced
from the zeal and talents of Innocent the third ⁸⁴. ’ᾤ’ Under that·
