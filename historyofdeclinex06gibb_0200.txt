THE DECLINE AND FALL

lised in the two sieges of Constantinople. After the slight of Mour-
zoufle, when the Latius were already in the city, he offered himself
as their emperor to the soldiers and people ε and his ambhion, which
might be virtuous‚ was undoubtedly brave. Could he have infused
a soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers
under their feet: their abjess despair refused his aid, and Theodore
retired to breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia‚ beyond the immess
diate view and pursuit of the conquerors. Under the title, at first
of despot‚ and afterwards of emperor, he drew to his standard the
bolder spirits, who were fortified against ssavery by the contempt of

life; and as every means was lawful for the public safety, implored
without scruple the alliance of the Turkish sultan. Nice, where

Theodore establissied his refidence, Prusa and philadelphia, Smyrna
and Ephesus, opened their gates to their deliverer: he derived
strength and reputation from his vietories, and even from his de-

»feats3 and the successor of Constantine preserved a fragment of the

empire from the banks of the Maeander to the suburbs of Nicomedia,
and at length of Constantinople. Another portion, distant and ob-
scure, <was poffeffed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son of the
virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus. His name
was Alexius 3 and the epithet of great was applied perhaps to his
statu-re, rather than to his exploits. By the indulgence of the Angeli,
he was appointed governor ror duke of Trebizo'nd ²¹: his birth gave
him ambition‚ the revolution independence3 and without ehanging

'his title, he reigned in peace from Sinope to the Phafis‚ along the

coast of the Black Sea. His nameless son and su-cceffor is described

without much pleasure or hope), are learnedly it is conspicuous only in the romances of the ’
