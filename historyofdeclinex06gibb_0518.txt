THE DECLINE AND FALL

despair of Constantine cast away the purple: amidst the tumult he Ι
fell by an unknown hand, and his body was buried under a moun-
tain of the ssain. After his death, refistance and order were no
more: the Greeks fled towards the city3 and many were preffed
and stifled in the narrow pass of the gate of St. Romanus. The
vidiorious Turks rushed through the breaches of the inner wall3
and as they advanced into the streets, they were soon joined by their
brethren‚ who had forced the gate Phenar on the fide of the har-
bour ⁶². In the first heat of the purthit, about two thousand Chris-
tians were put to the sword3 but avarice soon prevailed over crnelty3
and the vietors acknowledged, that they ssmuld immediately have
given quarter if the valour of the emperor and his chosen bands had
not prepared them for a similar oppofition in every part of the capi—
tal. It was thus, after a siege of fifty-three days, that Constanti-
nople, which had defied the power of Chosroes, the (lh-agan, and the
caliphs, was irretrievably subdued by the arms of Mahornet the
second. Her empire only had been subverted by the Latins: her

religion was trampled in the dust by the Mossem conquerors ‘ .
