W veterans were grateful: the priest and the philosopher applauded his

ardent zeal for the advancement of religion and learning3 and his

vague promise of rewarding merit, was applied by every candidate

successfully laboured to secure the suffrage of that powerful order.
Their expenfive journey from Nice to Magnesia, afforded a decent

berality of his nocturnal visits3 and the incorruptible patriarch was
flattered by the homage of his new colleague, who led his mule
by the bridle into the town, and removed to a respectful distance
the importunity of the crowd. 'Without renouncing his title by
royal descent‚ Palaeologus encouraged a free discuffion into the ad-
vantages of elective monarchy3 aud his adherents asked‚ with the

insolence of triumph, what patient would trust his heahh, or what

invested with the title and prerogatives of dffot, which bestowed
the purple ornaments, and the second place in the Roman monarchy.
It was afterwards agreed that John and Michael should be proclaimed
as joint-emperors, and raised on the buckler, but that the pre-emi-
nence should be reserved for the birth-right of the former. A
