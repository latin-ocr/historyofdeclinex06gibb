OF· THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Apocaucus; and to exaggerate his perfidy, the Imperial historian- is
pleased to magnify his own imprudence, in raising him to that office
against the advice of his more sagacioris sovereign. Bold and subtle,
rapacious and profuse, th'e avarice and ambition of Apocaucus were
by turns subservient to each other; and his talents were applied to
the ruin of his country. His arrogance was heightened by the com-
mand of a naval force and an impregnable castle‚ and under the
mass: of oaths and flattery he secretly conspired against his bene-
ἱειξὶοτ. The female court of the empress was bribed and directed:
he encouraged Anne of Savoy to affert, by the law of nature, the
tutelage of her son3 the love of power-was disguised by the anxiety
of maternal'tenderness3 and the founder of the Palaeologi had in«
strueted his posterity to dread the example of a, perfidions guardian.
The patriarch John of Apri, was a proud and feeble old man, en-
compaffed by a numerous and hungry kindred. He produced an
obsoleta epist'le of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and
people to his pious care: ther fate of his predeceffor Arsenius
prompted him to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of an
usurper; and Apocaucus smiled at the success of his own fiattery,
whenhe-beheld the Byzantine priest assuming, the state and tem-

poral claims of the Roman-pontiff²⁶. Between three personsso differ--

ent in their situation and character, a private league was concluded :
assiadow of authority was restored to the senate3 and the people was

tempted by the name of freedom. By this powerful confederacy‚.
the great-domestic was affanlted at first with clandestine, at length.
