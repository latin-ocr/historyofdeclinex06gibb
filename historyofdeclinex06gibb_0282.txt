ed warnings os danger3 and retiring to rest in the yain security of
ignorancer abandoned the feeb'le monarch, with some priests and
pages‚ to thc terrors of a sseepless night. These terrors were quickly
realized by the hostile ihouts‚ which proclaimed the titlcs and vic-
tory of Andronicus the younger3 and the aged emperor, falling
prostrate before an image of the Virgin, dispatched a suppliant mes-
sage to refign the sceptre‚ and to obtain his life at the hands of the
conqueror. The ansvver of his grandson was decent and pious ; at
the prayer of his friends, the younger Andronicus assumed the sole

” administration3 but the elder still enjoyed the name and pre—emi-

nence of the first emperor, the use of the great palace, and a pen-
fion of twenty-four thousand pieces of gold, one half of which was
affigned on the royal treasure‚ and the other on the fishery of Con-
stantinople. But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt and
oblivion ; the vast filence of the palace was disturbed only by the
cattle and poultry of the neighbourhood, which roved with im*-
punity through the solitary courts ; and a reduced allowance of ten
thousand pieces of gold¹¹ was all that he could ask, and-more than
he could hope. His calamities were embittered by the gradual ex-
tinCtion of sight ; his confinement was rendered each day more ri·-
gorous5 and during the absence and fickness of his grandson, his
inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant death, compelled him to ν
exchange the purple for themonastic habit and profeffion. The monk
Antony had renounced the pomp of the world: yet he had occa-
fion for a coarse fur in the winter season, and as wine was forbidden
by his confessor, and water by his physicum, the ffierbet of Egypt
was his common drink. It was not-without difficulty that the late
