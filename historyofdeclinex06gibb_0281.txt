and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless prospe& of a
reign, whose favoni-ites and maxims were of other times. The
youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, his age was without
reverence: his taxes produced an annual revenue of five hundred
thousand pounds 3 yet the richest of the sovereigns of Christendom
was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse and twenty
gallies, to reslst the destructive progress of the Turks ⁹. “ How dif-
“ ferent,” said the younger Andronicus, “ is my situation from that
“ of the son of Philip! Alexander might complain, that his father
“ would leave him nothing to conquer: alas! my grandfire will-
“ leave me nothing to lose.” But the Greeks were soon admo-
nished, that the public disorders could not be healed by a civil war ς,
and that their young favourite was not destined to be the saviour
of a falling empire. On the first repulse, his party was broken by
his own levity‚ their intestine discord‚ and the intrigues of the an-
cient court‚ which tempted each malecontent to desert or betray
the cause of rebellion. Andronicus the younger was touched with
remorse, or fatigued with business, or deceived by negociation z plea-
sure rather than power was his aim3 and the licence of maintaining
a thousand hounds‚ a thousand hawks, and a thousand huntsmen, was
sufficient to sully his fame and disarm his ambition.

Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot, and the final Xffirzljff
