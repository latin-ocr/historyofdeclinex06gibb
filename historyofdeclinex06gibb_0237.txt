But their lqffi‘s, in this sense, were far superior to their gifts and cx- C H A p⁴

peuces, and their heirs, not less than the poor, were the objects of μην... 1

their paternal care, The sums which they paid for livery and
sehin, attest the greatness of their poffeffions ; and several estates
have remained in their family fince the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. In war, the Courtenays of England fulfilled the duffies,
and deserved the honours, of chivalry. They were often entrusted
to levy and command the militia of Devonshire and Cornwall ; they
often attended their supreme lord to the borders of Scotland ; and in
foreign service, for a stipulated price, they sometimes maintained
fourscore men at arms and as many archers. By sea and land they
fought under the standard of the Edwards and Hem-ies : their names
are conspicuous in battles, in tournaments, and in the original list of
the order of the garter; three brothers shared the Spanish victory of
the Black Prince3 and in the lapse of six generations, the English
Courtenays had learned to dispise the nation and country from which
they derived their origin. In the quarrel of the tvvo roses, the earls of
Devon 'adhered to the house of Lancaster, and three brothers succeffively
died, either in the field or on the scaffold. Their honours and estates

were restored by Henry the seventh; a daughter of Edward the fourth
was not disgraced by the nuptials of a Courtenay ; their son, who was
created marquis of Exeter, enjoyed the favour of his cousin Henry the
eighth3 and in the camp of Cloth of Gold, he broke a lance against the
French monarch. But the favour of Henry was the prelude of disgrace3
his disgrace was the signal of death3 and of the victims of the jealous
tyram, the marquis of Exeter is one of the most noble and guiltless.
His son Edward lived a prisoner in the Tower, and died an exile at
Padua3 and the secret love of queen Mary, whom he ssighted‚ perhaps
for the princess Elizabeth, has shed a romantic colour on the story
of this beautiful youth. The relies of his patrimony were con-
veyed into strange families by the marriages of. his four aunts3 and

nffigned ιο a Rivers carl of Devon: but the English denotes the xv‘h, rather than the xiiith·

century. F f h.
