THE DECLINE AND FALL

and an epigram of the same age expresses a just and pious sear,
that the continuance of this practice would finally annihilare all‘the
monuments of antiquity³⁶. The smallness of their numbers was
the sole check on the demands and depredatione. of the Romans.

The imagination of Petrarch might create the presence of a mighty
people³⁷3 and 1 hefitate to believe, that, even in the fourteenth cen-
tury, they could be reduced to a contemptible list of thirty-three
thousand inhabitants. From that period to the reign of Leo the tenth,
if they multiplied to the amount of eighty-five thousand³⁸‚ the en·-
crease of citizens was in some degree pernicious to the ancient city.

IV. I have reserved for the last, the most potent and forcible cause
of destruction, the domestic hostilities of the Romans themselves.
Under the dominion ofthe Greek and French emperors, the peace of
the city was disturbed by accidental‚ though frequent, seditions: it
is from the decline of the latter, from the beginning of the tenth
century, that we may date the licentiousness of private war, which
violated with impunity the lavvs of the Code and the Gospel 3 ‘with-
out respedfing the majesty of the absent sovereign, or the presence
and person of the vicar of Christ. In a dark period of five hundred
years, Rome was perpetually afflicted by the sanguinary quarrels of
the nobles and the people‚ the Guelphs and Ghibelines, the Colonna
and Ursini; and if much has escaped the knowledge, and much is

ing chapters, the causes and effects of the public disorders. At such
