376 THE DECLINE AND FALL
C {lxx} Ρ· tube, a ball of stone or iron might be expelled with irrefistible and

b—v—-e destructive velocity. The precise aera of the invention and appli-
cation of gunpowder⁹¹ is involved in doubtful traditions and equivo-
cal language3 yet we may clearly discern, that it was known before

the middle of the fourteenth century; and that before the end of
the same, the use of artillery in battles and sieges, by sea and
land, was familiar. to the states of Germany, Italy, Spain, France,
and England ⁹². The priority of nations is of small account; none
could derive any exclusive benefit from their previous or superior
knowledge3 and in the common improvement they stood on the

same level of relative power and military science. Nor was it pos-
fible to circumscribe the secret within the pale of the church 3 it was
disclosed to the Turks by the treachery of apostates and the selfish
policy of rivals ; and the sultans had sense to adopt, and wealth to
reward, the talents of a Christian engineer. The Genoese, who
transported Amurath into Europe, must be accused as his preceptors;
and it was probably by their hands that his cannon was cast and

directed at the siege of Constantinople ⁹³. The first attempt was in·

deed unsuccessfu13 but in the general warfare of the age, the advari-¹
tage was on their side, who were most commonly the affailants;
for a while the proportion of the attack and defence was suspended;
and this thundering artillery was pointed against the walls and towers

cannot be trusted. The original passages are
collected by Ducange (Gloff. Latin. tom. i.
p. 675. Bombarda). But in the early doubt—
ful twilight, the name, found, fire, and ef-
feci, that seem to express our anillery, may
be fairly interpreted of the old engines and
zhe Greek fire. For the English cannon at
Crecy‚ the authority of John Villani (Chron.

p. 514, 5¹5·) has produced a decifive paffage
from Petrarch (de Remediis utriusque For-
tunae Dialog.)‚ who, before the year 1344,
execrates this terrestrial thunder, nuper rara,
nunc communis.

⁹³ The Turkish cannon, which Ducas'
(c. 30.) first introduces before Belgrade (A.D.
1436), is mentioned by Chalcondyles (1. v.
p. ¹23·) in 1422, at the siege of Constanti-
nople„
