was displayed in the field with terror and effefl, His services were
repaid by the ingratitudo of a pcople unworthy of the happiness
which they enjoyed. By the public robbers, whom he had pro-
voked for their sake, the Romans were excited to depose and im-
prison their benefa&or; nor would his life have been spared, if
Bologna had not possessed a pledge for his safety. Before his de-
parture, the prudent senator had required the exchange of thirty
hostages of the noblest families of Rome: on the news of his
danger, and at the prayer of his wife, they were more strictly
guarded3 and Bologna‚ in the cause of honour, sustained the
thunders of a papal interdiet. This generous refistance allowed the
Romans to compare the present with the past ; and Brancaleone was
conducted from the prison to the Capitol amidst the acclamations of
a repentant people. The remainder of his government was firm
and fortunate3 and as soon as envy was appeased by death, his head,
enclosed in a precious vase, was deposited on a lofty column of
marble ⁴⁹.
