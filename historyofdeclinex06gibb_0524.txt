THE- DECLJNE AND FALL

C H A P- of the same day3 when the sultan himself paffed in triumph through

LXVIII.

k--v—-J the gate‘ of St. Romanus. He was attended by his vizirs, batham,

and guards, each of whom (says a Byzantine historiam) was robust
as Hercules, dextrous as Apollo, and equal in battle to any ten of
the race of ordinary mortals. The conqueror ⁷⁴ gazed with satisfac·
tion and wonder on the strange though splendid appearance of the
domes and palmes, so diffimilar from the style of Oriental architec- ’
ture. In the hippodrome, or cztnzcidan, his eye was attracted by the
tvvisted column of the three serpents; and, as a trial of his strength,
he shattered with his iron mace or battle-axe the under jaw of one
of these monsters⁷⁵‚ which in the eyes of the Tur-ks were the idols
or talismans of the city. At the principa] door of? St. Sophia, he
alighted from his horse, and entered the dome: and such was his

jealous regard for that monument of his glor-y, that on observing a
zealous Musulman in the a& of breaking the marble pavement‚ he
admonilhed him with his scymetar‚ that, if the spoil and captives
were granted to the soldiers, the public and private buildings had
been reserved for the prince. By his command, the metropolis of
the Eastern church was transformed into a mosch: the rich and
portable instruments of superstition had been removed3 the croffes
were thrown down3 and the walls, which were covered with images
and mosaics, were washed and purified, and restored to a state of
naked fimplicity. On the same day, or on the ensuing Friday‚ the
murzin or crier ascended the most lofty turret, and proclaimed the
man, or public invitation in the name of God and his prophet; the
imam preached 3 and Mahomet the second performed the namaz of
prayer and thanksgiving on the great altar, where the Christian
mysteries had so lately been celebrated before the last of the Caesars⁷⁶.

⁷⁵ l have had occasion (vol. ii: p. 16, 17.) and Ducas. It is amusing enough to observe‚
to mention this carious relic of Graecian anxi· in what opposite lights the same objest ap-
quity. pears to a Musulman and a Christian eye.
