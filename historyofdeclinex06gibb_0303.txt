the only virtue of the emperor was patience3 and the hope of re-
venge his sole consolation. Yet the distress of both parties inter-
posed a temporary agreement3 and the shame of the empire was
disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the
chiefs of the colony, Cantacuzene affeeted to despise the trivial ob-

the lands, which had been previoussy refigned to the seeming custody

,of his Officers ⁵⁰.

But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty‚ and to

join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of Genoa
and her colonies. While he compared the reasons of peace and
war, his moderation was provoked by a wanton insult of the in-
habitants of Pera, who discharged from their rampart a large stone
that fell in the midst of Constantinople. On his just complaint‚
they coldly blamed the imprudence of their engineer ; but the next
day the insult was repeated, and they exulted in a second proof that
the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery. Canta-
cuzene instantly figned his treaty with the Venetians; but the
weight of the Roman empire was scarcely felt in the balance of these
opulent and powerful republics⁵¹. From the streights of Gibraltar
to the mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered each other with
various success ; and a memorable battle was fought in the narrow

sea‚<under the walls of Constantinople. It would not be an easy
