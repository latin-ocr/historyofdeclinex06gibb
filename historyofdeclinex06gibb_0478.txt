THE DECLINE AND FALL

even suspicions haste3 the claim of Demetrius to the vacant throne
was justified by a trite and flimsy sophism, that he was born in the
purple, the eldest son of his father’s reign. But the empress-mother,
the senate and soldiers, the clergy and people‚ were unanimous in the·
cause of the lawful succeff0r3 and the despot Thomas, who, igno-
rant of the change, accidentally returned to the capital, asserted with

becoming zeal the interest of his absent brother. An ambaffador,
the historian P‘hranza, was immediately dispatched to the court of

Adrianople. Amurath received him with honour and dismiffed
him with gifts; but the gracious approbation of the Turkish fultan

the Byzantine nobles objected the distance between an hereditary
monarch and an elective magistrate; and in their subsequent dis-
tress, the chief of that powerful republic was not unmind'ful of the

affront. Constantine afterwards hefitated between the royal families
of Trebizond and Georgia3 and the embaffy of Phranza represents

in his public and private life the last days of the Byzantine em-
pire⁴⁸.

The protovssiare, or great chamberlain, Phranza sailed from Con-
stantinople as the minister of a bridegr00m3 and the relies of wealth
