veral of these are described by Nicetas⁹⁵‚ in a florid and affected κ-Ὓ-ι

ilyle5 and, from his descriptions, I shall sele& some interesting pas..
ticulars. 1. The victorious charioteers were cast in bronze, at their
own, or the public, charge, and fitly placed in the hippodrome:
*they stoodaloft in their chariots, wheeling round the g0a13 the spec-
tators could admire their attitude‚ and judge of the resen1blance;
and of these figures, the most perfect might have been transported
'from the Olympic stadium. 2. The sphynx, river-horse, anthero-
, codile, denote the climate and manufaaure of Egypt, and the spoils

'Remus3 a subject alike pieasing to theold and the new Romans;

air, rather than on the earth. 7. A square and lofty obelissz of brass3
the fides were emboffed with a variety of pirsturesque and rural
fcenes: birds finging3 rustics labouring, or playing on their pipes;
fixeep bleating3 lambs skipping3 the sea, and a scene of fifh and
fishing; little naked cupids laughing, playing‚ and pelting each other

with apple53 and, onthe summit, a female figure turning with the
