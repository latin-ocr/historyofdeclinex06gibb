OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

poffeffed of a strong city and a capacious harbour3 and the same C H A Ρ-
reign might have been decorated with the trophies of the NEW and

comanni di Giovanni Sagredo (Venezia,
1677, in 4¹⁰). ln peace and war, the Turks
have ever engaged the attention of the re-
public of Venice. All her dispatches and
archives were open to a procurator of St.
Mark‚ and Sagredo is not contemptible either
in sense or stysse. Yet he too bittedy hates
the infidels; he is ignorant of their language
and manners; and his narrative, which al-
lows only seventy pages to Mahomet 11.
(p. 69—140.), becomes more copious and
authentic as he approaches the years 1640
and ¹6440 the term of the historic labours of
John Sagaedo.

⁹⁷ As Ι am now making an everlastIng fare-
wellof the Greek empire, 1 shall briefly men-
tion the great colleffion of Byzantine writers,
whose names and testimonies have been
succeffively repeated in this work. The Greek
preffes of Aldus and the Itaxians, were con-

fined to the claffics ofa better age; and the fust
rude editions of Procopius, Agmhias, Ce-
drenus, Zonaras, &c. were publifhed by the
learned diligence of the Germans. The
whole Byzantine series (xxxvi volumes in
folio) has gradually issued (A.D. 1648, Sec.)
From the royal press ofthe Louvre, with some
collateral aid from Rome and Leipfic; but
the Venetian edition (A.D. 1729), though
cheaper and more copious, is not less infe-
rior in correctness than in magnificence to
that of Paris. The men-its of the French
editors are various; but the value of Anna
Comnena, Cinnamus, Villehardouin, ἀς.
is enhanced by the historica} notes of Charles
du Fresne du Cange. His supplement-‘³1
works‚ the Greek Gloffary, the Constanti-
nopolis Christiana, the Familiae Byzaminae,
diffuse a steady light over the darkness of
the Lower Empire.
