of prolonging the divifion of the Ottoman powers, the policy or
passion of Manuel was tempted to affist the most formidable of the
sons of Bajazet. He concluded a treaty with Mahomet, whose pro-
gress was checked by the insuper-able barrier- of Gallipoli: the sultan

cruelty of their brother Amurath. But the execution of his last
testament would have offended the national honour and religion:

three hundred thousand aspers ⁸¹. At the door of his prison, Musta-
pha subscribed to every proposa13 and the keys of Gallipoli, or rather
of Europe, were stipulated as the price of his deliverance. But no
sooner was he seated on the throne of Romania, than he dismissed
the Greek ambaffadors with a smile of contempt, declar-ing, in a
pious tone, that, at the day ofjudgment‚ he would rather answer
for the violation of an cath, than for the surrender of a Musulman
