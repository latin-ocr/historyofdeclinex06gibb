THE DECLINE AND FALL

of claffie antiquity⁵⁷. Instead of the naked spthacles which cor-

the virgins and matrons ; the pompous decoration of the lists was
crowned with the presence of chaste and high—born beauty, from
whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his dexterity and
courage. The skill and strength that were exerted in wrestling and

service3 and the contest, both in real and mimic war, was decided
by the superior management of the horse and lance. The lance
was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of
