curfions by sea andland: he left nine thousand five hundred men
for the guard of his fleet3 and perseveret] in the fruitless search of
Cantacuzene‚ till his embarkation was hastened by a fictitious letter,
the severity of the seas0n‚ the clamours of his independent troops,
and the weight of his spoil and captives. In the prosecution of the
civil war, the prince of Ionia twice returned to Europe ; joined his
arms with those of the emperor 3 besieged Thessalonica, and threatened
Constantinople. Calumny might affix some reproach on his imper-
fest aid, his hasty departure, and a bribe of ten thousand crowns,
which he accepted from the Byzantine court; but his friend was sa-
tisfied3 and the conduct of Amir is excused by the more sacred
duty of defending against the Latins his hereditary dominions. The
maritime power of the Turks had united the pope, the king of
Cyprus, the republic of Venice, and the order of St. John, in a
laudable crusade3 their gallies invaded the coast of Ionia ; and Amir
was ssain with an arrow, in the attempt to wrest from the Rhodian
knights the citadel of Smyrna⁴⁸. Before his death, he generoussy
recommended another ally of his own nation3 not more fincere or
zealous than himself, but more able to afford a prompt and powerful
succour, by his situation along the Propontis and in the front of
Constantinople. By the prospect of a more advantageous treaty, the
T urkissi prince of Bithynia was detached from his engagements with
Anne of Savoy; and the pride of Orchan dictated the most solemn
protestations, that if he could obtain the daughter of Cantacuzene,
he would invariably fulfil the duties of a subject and a fon. Parental
tenderness was silenced by the voice of ambition 3 the Greek clergy
connived at the marriage of a Christian princess with a lectary of
Mahomet; and the father of Theodora describes, with ssiameful sa-
