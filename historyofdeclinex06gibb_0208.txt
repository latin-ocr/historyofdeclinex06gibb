u-svssa the Hellespont, he had deserved the fame of a valiant knight and a
skilful commander3 and his courage was temper-ed with a degree

their serjeants and archers, could be affembled under his banner3 and
with this ssender force he fought and repulsed the Bulgarian, who,
befides his infantry, was at the head of forty thousand horse. In

friendly country3 the remaining cities were preserved by his arms}
and the savage, with shame and loss, was compelled to relinquish
his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was the last of the evils which
