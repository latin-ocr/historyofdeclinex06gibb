OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Before 1 lose fight of the field of XVarna, I am tcmptcd to pause
⁴on the character and story of two principal atstors, the cardinal Ju-
lian and John Huniades. Julian '⁹ Caesarini was born of a noble
family of Rome: his studies had embraced both the Latin and Greek
learning, both the sciences of divinity and lavv; and his versatile
genius was equally adapted to the schools, the camp, and 'the court.
No sooner had he been invested with the Roman purple, than he was
sent vinto Germany to arm the empire against the rebels and heretica
:of Bohemia. The spirit of persecution is unworthy of a Christian ;
the military profeffion ill becomes a priest; but the former is ex-
cused by the times 3 and the latter was ennobled by the courage of
Julian, who stood 'dauntless and alone in the disgraceful flight of the
German host. As the pope's legate, he opened the council of Bafil 3
but the prefident soon appeared the most strenuous champion of
‘ecclefiastical freedom ; and an opposition of seven years was con-
ducted by· his ability and zeal. After promoting the strongest mea-
sures against the authority and' person of Eugenius, some secret mo-
tive of interest or conscience engaged him to desert on a sudden the
popular party. The cardinal withdrew himself from Bafil to Fer-
rara ; and, in the debates of the Greeks and Latins, the two nations
admired the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theo-
logical eruditiori ³⁰. In his Hungarian embass‘y we have already
seen the mischievous effeecs of his sophistry and eloquence, of which
Julian himself was the first vietim. The cardinal, who performed
