OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

claimed by the homely portrait of the age and infirmities of his
weeping spouse⁵⁸. But the cloud which hung over the seven hius,
would be dispelled by the presence of their lawful sovereign: eternal
fame, the prosperity of Rome, and the peace of Italy, would be the
recompence of the pope who should dare to embrace this generous
resolution. Of the five whom Petrai-ch exhorted, the three first,
John the twenty-second, Bencdi& the twelfth‚ and Clement the fixth,
were importuned or amused by the boldness of the orator3 but the
memorable change which had been attempted by Urban the fifth,
was finally accomplished by Gregory the eleventh. The execution
of their defign was opposed by weighty and almost insuperable ob-
stacles. A king of France who has deserved the epithet of wife, was
unwilling to release them from a local dependence : the cardinale„ for
the mos} part his subjeffihs, were attached to the language, manners,
and climate, of Avignon3 to their stately palaces 3 above all, to the
wines of Burgundy. In their eyes, Italy was foreign or hostile3
and they relu&antly embarked at Marseilles‚ as if they had been sold
or banished into the land of the Saracens. Urban the fifth refided
three years in the Vatican with safety and honour: his sanetity was
protched by a guard of two thousand horse3 and the king of Cyprus,
the queen of Naples, and the emperors of the East and West de-
voutly saluted their common father in the chair of St. Peter. But the
joy of Petrarch and the Italians was soon turned into grief and in-
dignation. Some reasons of public or private moment, his own
impatience or the prayers of the cardinals, recalled Urban to France;
and the approaching electiori was saved from the tyrannic patriotism
of the Romans. The powers of heaven were interested in their
cause: Bridget of Sweden, a saint and pilgrim, disapproved the re-
