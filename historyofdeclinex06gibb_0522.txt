THE DECLINE AND FALL

In the fall and the sack of great eides, an historian is condemned
to repeat the tale of uniform calamity: the same effects must be
produced by the same paffions; and when those paflions may be
indulged without control, small, alas! is the difference between ci-
vilized and savage man. Amidst the vague exclamations of bigotry
and hatred, the Turks arc not accnsed of a wanton or immoderate
effuslon of Christian blood: but according to their maxims (the
maxims of antiquity)‚ the lives of the vanquished were forfeited;
and the legitimate reward of the conqueror was derived from the
service, the sale„ or the ransom, of his captives of both sexes ⁶⁹. The
wealth of Constantinople had been granted by the sultan to his vic-
torious troops: and the rapine of an bour is more productive than
the industry of years. But as no regular division was attempted of
the spoil, the respec‘live shares were not determined by merit; and
the rewards of valonr were stolen away by the followers of the camp,
who had declined the toil and danger of the battle. The narrative
of their depredations could not afford either amusement or instruc-
tion: the total amount, in the last poverty of the empire, has been
valued at four millions of ducats⁷⁰; and of this sum, a small part
was the property of the Venetiam, the Genoese, the Florentines,
and the merchants of Ancona. Of these foreigners, the stock was
improved in quick and perpetual circulation: but the riches of the
Greeks were displayed in the idle ostentation of palaces and ward-
robes, or deeply buried in treasures of ingots and old coin, lest it
should be demanded attheir hands for the defence of their country.
The profanation and plunder of the monasteries and churches„ ex-
cited the most tragic complaints. The dome of St. Sophia itself‚ the
