or the nature of the war, the king of France advanced through the C H ,ᾼ ¹³·
same country to a slmilar fate. The vanguard‚'which bore the h-I-{J-—ae
royal banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys ²¹, had doubled their
march with rash and inconsiderate speed3 and the rear which the
king commanded in person no longer found their companions in
the evening camp. In darkness and disorder they were encompaffid,
affaulted‚ and overwhelmed, by the innumerable host of Turks,
who iu the art of war were superior to the Christians of the
· twelfth century. Louis‚ who climbed a tree in the general discom-
fiture‚ was saved by his own valour and the ignorance of his ad-
versaries; and with the dawn of day he escaped alive, but almost
alone to the camp of the vanguard. But instead of pursuing his ex-
pedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the relies of his army
in the friendly sea-port of Satalia. From thence he embarked for
Antioeh3 but so penurious was the supply of Greek vessels, that

they could only afford roorn for his knights and nobles; and the
plebeian crowd of infantry was left to perish at the foot of the Pam-
phylian hille. The emperor and the king embraced and wept at
Jerusalem ; their martial trains, the remnant of mighty armies, were
joined to the Christian powers of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Da·-
mascus was the final effort of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis
embarked for Europe with the personal fame of piety and courage ;
but the Orientals had 'braved these potent monarehs of the Franks,
with whose names and military forces they had been so often threat-
ened²². Perhaps they had still more to fear from the veteran genius
of Frederic the first, who in his youth had served in Afia under his
uncle Conrad. Forty campaigns in Germany and Italy had taught
