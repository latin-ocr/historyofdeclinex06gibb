3¹3 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ἒἩῦ. P· dempti0n3 and the indigent Greeks deplored the fate of their bre-
μ-Ύ-ῡα thren, who were led away to the worst evils of temporal and
spiritual bondage ⁵⁰. Cantacuzene was reduced to subscribe the same
terms ; and their execution must have been still more pernicious to
the empire: a body of ten thousand Turks had been detached to
the affistance of the empress Anne3 but the entire forces of Orchan
were exerted in the service of his father. Yet these calamities were
of a transient nature ; as soon as the storm had passed away, the
fugitives might return to their habitation33 and at the conclusion of
the civil and foreign wars, Europe was completely evacuated by the
Mossems of Asia. It was in his last quarrel with his pupil that
Cantacuzene inflicted the deep and deadly wound, which could never
be healed by his succeffors, and which is poorly expiated by his
theological dialogues against the prophet Mahornet. Ignorant of
their own history, the modern Turks confound their first and their
final paffage of the Hellespont ⁵¹, and describe the son of Orch'an as a
nocturnal robber, who, with eighty companions, explores by strata-
gem an hostile and unknown shore. Soliman, at the head of ten
thousand horse, was transported in the vessels, and entertained as the
friend, of the Greek emperor. In the civil wars of Romania, he
performed some service and perpetrated more mischief ; but the
Chersonesus was insenfibly filled with a Turkish colony3>and the.
Byzantine court solicited in vain the restitution of the fortreffes of
Thrace. After some artful delays between the Otto-man prince and
his son, their ransom was valued at fixty thousand'crowns, and the
first payment had been made, when an. 'earthquake shook the walls
and cities of the provinces ; the dismantled places were occupied by
the Turks; and Gallipoli, the key of the Hellespont, was rebuilt

‘Ducas (c. 8.)‚ who fairly describes what δια). They forget to consult the most au-
