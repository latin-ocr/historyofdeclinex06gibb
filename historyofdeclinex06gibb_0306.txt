, FROM the petty quarrels of a city and her subm-bs, from the

cowardice and discord of the falling Greeks, I shall now
ascend to the νίἃοῑίοηε Turks; whose domestic ssavery was ennobled
by martial discipline, religious enthufiasm, and the energy of the na-
tional charadier. The rise and progress of the OttomanS, the present
sovereigns of Constantinople, are connected with the most import-
ant scenes of modern history: but they are founded on a previous
knowledge of the great eruption of the Moguls and Tartars3 whose
rapid conquests may be compared with the primitive convulfions of
nature, which have agitated and altered the furface of the globe.
Ι have long since asserted my claim to introduce the nafions, the im-
mediate or remote authors of the -fall'of the Roman empire3 nor
canI refuse myself to those events, which, from their uncommon

magnitude, will interest a philosophie mind in the history of blood ¹. ⁵ Ι

manners of pastoral natione, the conquests of than the hope, of concluding my history.
