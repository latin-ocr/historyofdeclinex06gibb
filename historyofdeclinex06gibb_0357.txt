of gold and filver ²⁹. On the banks of the Don, or Tanais, he re- s-..v-ssa
ceived an humble deputation from the consuls and merchants of
Egypt ²¹, Venice, Germa, Catalonia‚ and Biscay, who occupied the
commerce and city of Tana, or Azoph, at the mouth of the river.
They offered their gifts, admired his magnificam, and trusted his
royal word. But the peaceful vifit of an emir, who explored the

state of the magazines and harbour, was speedily followed by the

destruc’tive presence of the Tartars. The city was reduced to ashe33

the Mossems were pillaged and dismiffed3 but all the Christians, who
had not fled to their ships, were condemned either to death or
ssavery ²². Revenge prompted him to burn the cities of Serai and
Astraehan, the monuments of rising civilization ; and his vanity pro-
claimed‚ that he had penetrated to the region of perpetual daylight,
a strange phenomen0n‚ which authorised his Mahometan doc‘tors to

p. 247· Vie de Timour, p. 64-67. be-
*fore the French verfion of the In stitutes)
has corrected the error of Sherefeddin, and
marked the true limit of Timour's conquests,
His arguments are superfluous, and a {imple
appeal to the Ruffian Annals is sufficient to
prove that Mostow, which fix years before
had been taken by Teitamish, escaped the
arms of a more formidable invader.

²¹ An Egyptian consul from Grand Casto,
is mentioned iu Barbaro’s voyage to Tana
in 1436, after the city had been rebuilt (Ra-
musto, tom.ii. fol.9z.).

²² The sack of Azoph is described by She-

sz

Tarvifiano, in Muratori Script. Rerum Itali-
carum, tom. xix. p. soz-803.). He had
conversed with the Mianis, two Venetian
brothers, one of whom had been sent a de-
puty to the camp of Timour‚ and the ozhec
had lost a? Azoph three sons and iz‚000 du-
cats.

²³ Shereseddin only says (l. iii. c. 13.)ν,μ

that the rays of the setting, and those of the
rising sun, were scarcely separated by any
interval3 a problem which may be solved in
the latitude of Moscow (the 5L‘h degree), with
the aid of the Aurora Borealis, and a long
summer twilight. But a day of forty days
(Khondemir apud d’Herbelot, p.8130.) would
rigoroussy confine us within the polar circle.
