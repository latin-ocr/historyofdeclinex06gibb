THE DECLINE AND FALL

he said, in the power of man : that prince had died in prison 3 and
the manner of his death is varioussy related by ignorance and cre-
(lulity. The lovers of a tragic legend will be pleased to hear, that
the royal captive was ternpted by the amorous queen of the Bulga-
rians3 that his chaste refusal exposed him to the falsehood of a wo-
man and the jealousy of a savage3 that his hands and feet were
severed from his body3 that his bleeding trunk was cast among the
carcases of dogs and horses3 and that he breathed three days, before
he was clevoured by the birds of prey²⁹. About twenty years af-
terwards, in a wood of the Netherlands‚ an hermit announced him-
self as the true Baldwin, the emperor of Constantinople‚ and lawful
sss-:ereign of Flanders. He related the wonders of his escape, his
adventures, and his penance, among a people prone to believe and
ro rebel 3 and, in the first transport‚ Flanders aeknowledged her long-
lost fover-eigo. A short examination before the French court de-

the laws of war-3 liis prisons were involved in darkness and filence;
and above a year elapsed before the Latius could be affured of the
death of fflldwin, before his brother, the regent He‘nry‚ would con-
sent to assume the title of emperor. His moderatiori was applauded
