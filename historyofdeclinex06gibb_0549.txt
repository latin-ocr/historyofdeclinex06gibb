rich, now the first of the Swiss cantens. From a Roman station ²³,
a royal villa, a chapter of noble virgins, Zurich had gradually en-
creased to a free and flourishing city3 where the appeals of the
Milanese were sometimes tried by the Imperial cominisshries²⁴. In
an age less ripe for reformation, the praecursor of Zuinglius was

the bishop of Constance, and even the pope’s legate, who forgot,
for his sake, the interest of their master and their order. Their tardy
zezil was quickened by the fierce exhortations of St. Bernard ²⁵ ; and
the enemy of the church was driven by persecution to the desperate
measure of ere&ing his standard in Rome itself, in the face of the
successor of St. Peter.

Yet the courage of Arnold was not devoid of discretion ; he was
protee‘oed, and had perhaps been invited‚ by the nobles and people3
and in the service of freedom, his eloquence thundered over the
seven hills. Blending in the same discourse the texts of Livy and
St. Paul, uniting the motives of gosp-el, and of clame, enfflufiasm,
he admonished the Romarm, how strangely their patience and the
vices of the clergy had degenerated from the primitive times of the
church and the city. He exhorted them to affert the inalienable
rights of men and Christians3 to restore the laws and magistrates
