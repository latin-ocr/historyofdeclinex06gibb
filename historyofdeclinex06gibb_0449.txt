Constantinople was spread beyond the Alps3 and the natives of κ--ν--ι
France, Germany, and England¹¹⁴‚ imparted to their country the

sacred sire which they had kindled in the schools of Floreuce and

Rome¹¹⁵. In the productioris of the mind5 asin those of the soil,

accuracy of Budaeus, the taste of Erasmus, the copiousness of
StephenS, the erudition of Scaliger, the discernment of Reiske, οῖ

of Bentley. On the fide of the Latius, the discovery of printing·

was a casual advantage: but this useful art has been applied by

Aldus, and his innumerable succeffors, to perpetuare and‘multiply

the works of· antiqu-ity¹¹⁶. A fingle manuscript imported from Greece
is revived in ten thousand copies; and each copy is fairer than the
original. In this form, Homer and Plato would peruse with more
satisfaction their own writings: and their scholiasts must religa the.
prize to the labours of our western editors.

Before tlie revival of claffic literature, the Barbari'ans i'n Europe⁴ ffl'esgag? an

'¹⁴ The Greek language was introduced
into the university of Oxford in the last years
os ‹he xxm century, by Grocyn, Linacer, and
Latimer, whohad all studied at Florence under
Demetrius Chalcocondyles. See Dr. Knight’s
curious Life of Erasmus. Although a stout
atademical purior, he is forced to acknow-
l'edge‚ that Erasmus learned Greek at Ox—
ford, and taught it at Cambridge.

¹¹⁵ The jealous Italians were defirous of
keeping a monopoly of Greek learning.
Vlhen Aldus was about to publifh the Greek·
scholiasts on Sophocles and Euripides, Cave
(said they), cave hoc facias, ne Barbari istis
adjuti domi maneant, et pauciores in Italiam
ventitent (Dr. Knight‚ in his Life of· Eras-
mus, p. 365. from Beatus Rhenanus).

¹⁴⁶ The press of Aldus Manutussa Ro-
man, was established at Venice about the
year 1494: he printed abovefixty confider-
able works of Greek literature, almost all
for the first time3 several containing different
treatises and authors, and of several authors
two, three, or four editions (Fabric, Bibliot.
Graec. tom. xiii. p. 605, &c.). Yet his
glory must not tempt us to surget, that the
first Greek book, the Grammar of Constan-
tine Lafcaris, was printed at Milan iu *1476;
and that the Florence Homer of 1488' eif-
plays all the luxury of the typographical stt.
