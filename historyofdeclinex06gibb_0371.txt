Despina and her daughter to their father and husband3 but he pioussy
required, that the Servian princess‚ who had hitherto been indulged
in the profcssion of Christianity‚ should embrace without delay the
religion of the prophet. In the feast of victory, to which Bajazet
was invhed, the Mogul emperor placed a crown on his head and
a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn affurance of restoring him with
an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors. But the effe& of
this promise was disappointed by the sultan's untimely death z amidst
the care of the most skilful physicians‚ he expired of an apoplexy at

Akshehr‚ the Antioch of Pifidia, about nine months after his defeat. ·,

pomp, was conveyed to the mausoleum which he had erected at
Boursa; and his son Mousa, after receiving a rich present of gold
and jewels, of horses and armS, was invested by a patent in red ink

the East, is base and audacious3 and the harsh and ignominious
treatment of Bajazet is attested by a chain of witneffes, some of
whom shall be produced in the order of their time and country.
