THE DECLiNE AND FALL

doetrine of Barlaam was disgraced by his ssight and apostacy: the
Palamites triumphed3 and their adverihry, the patriarch John of
Apri, was deposed by the consent os the adverse fastions of the
state. In the charaeter os emperor and theologiam, Cantacuzene
presided in the synod of the Greek church, which established, as an
article of saith, the uncreated light of mount Thab0r3 and, after so
many insults, the reason of mankind was ssightly wounded by the

addition of a single absurdity. Many rolls of papcr or parchment
have been-blotted3 and the impenitent sestaries, who refused to sub-
scribe the orthodox creed‚ were deprived of the honours of Chris-
tian burial; but in the next age the question was forgotten3 nor
can I learn that the axe or the saggot were employed for the extir-

pation of the Barlaamite heresy ⁴².
For the conclusion of this chapter, Ι have reserved the Genoese

war, which {hook the throne of Cantacuzene‚ and betrayed the
debility of the Greek empire. The Genoese, who, aster the re-
covery of Constantinople, were seated in the suburb of Pera or
Galata, received that honourable fief from the bounty of the em-
peror. They were indulged in the use of their laws and magi-
strates 3 but they submitted to the duties of vaffals and subjects:
the forcible word of liegemen ⁴³ was borrowed from the Latin juris-
prudence ; and their podcsta, or chief, before he entered on his
office, saluted the emperor with loyal acclamations and vows of
fidelity. Genoa scaled a firm alliance with the Greeks; and, in
case of a defenfive war, a supply of fifty empty gallies, and a suc—
cour of fifty gallies completely armed and manned, was promised

⁴² See Cantacuzene (l. ii. c. 39, 40. l.iv. library‚ have added some {aas and ‘docu-
c. 3. 23, 24, 25.), and Nic. Gregoras (l. xi. ments. ·
c. 10. 1.xv. 3, 7, &c.), whose last books, ⁴³ Pachymer (l. v. c. 10.) very properly
from the xixffi to the xxivth, are almost con- explains λιζιες (ligius) by theg. The use of
fined to a subjeft so interesting to the authors. these words in the Greek and Latin of the
Boivin (in Vit. Nic. Gregorae), from the un· feuda] times, may be amply understood from
publistied books, and Fabricius (Bibliot. the Gloffaries ofDucange (Graec. p. 811,812.
Graec. tom. x. p. 462—473.), or rather Latin. tom.iv. p. 109—111.).
