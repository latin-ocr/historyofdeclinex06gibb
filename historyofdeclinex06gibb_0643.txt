OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

conflagrati0n3 but as soon as they are devoured, the greater edifices
which have refisted or escaped, are left as so -many issands in a state
of solitude and safety. From her situation, Rome Is exposed to the
danger of frequent inundations. Without excepting the Tyber‚ the
rivers that descend from either side of the Apennine have a ssiort
and irregular course: a shallow stream in the summer heats; an im-
petuous torrent, when it is swelled in the spring or winter, by the

the Tyber was encreased by unusual rains ; and the inundation, sur-
paffing all former measure of time and place, destroyed all the
buildings that were fituate below the hills of Rome. According to
the variety of ground, the same misehief was produced by different
means5 and the edifices were either swept away by the sudden im-
