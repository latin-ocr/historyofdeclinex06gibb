to the memorable fields of Thrasymene and Cannae. In the first of
these petty wars, thirty thousand ‘Romans were overthrown by a-
thousand German horse, whom Frederic Barbaroffa had detached to
the relief of Tusculum3 and if we number the ssain at three, the
prisoners at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most authentie and
moderate account. Sixty-eight years afterward they marched against
Viterbo in the ecclefiastical state with the whole force of the cit'y3
by a rare coalifion, t'ne Teutonic engle was blended, in the adverse
banners, with the keys of St. Peter3 and the pope's auxiliaries were
commanded by a count of Tholouse and a bissiop of W'inchester.
The Romans were discomfited with shame and ssaughter3 but the
Engliffi prelate must have indulged the vanity of a pilgrim, if
he multiplied their numbers to one hundred, and their loss in the
field to thirty, thousand men, Had the policy of the senate and the
discipline of the legions been restored with the Capitol, the divided
condition of Italy would have offered the fairest opportunity of a
second conquest. But in arms, the modern Romans were not above,
and in arts, they were far below,the common level of the neighbour-
ing republics. Nor was their warlike spirit of any long continu-
ance3 after some irregular sallies, they subfided in the national
apathy, in the neglect of military institutions, and in the disgraceful
and dangerous use of foreign mercenaries.
