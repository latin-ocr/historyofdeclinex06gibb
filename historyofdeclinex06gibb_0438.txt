420 THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

C 154sz Ρ· fifty years of age, a Byzantine ambassitdor, his friend, and a master
ι-β-’ὴι of both tongues, presented him with a copy of Homer3 and the
answer of Petrarch is at once expressivc of his eloquence‚ gratitude,
and regi-et. After celebrating the generossty of the donor, and the
value of a gift more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies,
he thus proceeds: “ Your present of the genuine and original text
“ of the divine poet, the sountain of all invention, is worthy of
“ yourself and of me: you have fulfilled your promise, and satisfied
“ my defires. Yet your liberality is still imperfect: with Homer
“ you should have given me yourself3 a guide‚ who could lead ‚me
“ into the fields of light, and disclose to my wondering eyes the
“ specious miracles of the Iliad and Odyffey. But, alas! Homer is
“ dumb, or Ι am deaf5 nor is it in my power to enjoy the beauty
“ which I poffess. I have seated him by the fide of Plato, the
“ prince of poets near the prince of philosophers; and Ι glory in
“ the fight of my illustrious guests. Of their immortal wrifings,
“ whatever had been transsated into the Latin idiom‚ Ι had already
“ acquired3 but, if there be no profit, there is some pleasurerin

‘⁴ beholding these venerable Greeks in their proper and national
‘⁶ habit.= Iam delighted with the aspect of Homer ; and as often
“ as I embrace the filent volume, I exclaim with a figh, illustrious
“ bard! with what pleasure should I listen to thy song, if my sense
“ of hearing were not obstruCted and lost by the death of one
‘⁴ friend, and in the much-lamented absence of another. Nor do I
“ yet despa'n·; and the example of Cato suggests some comfort and
‘⁶ hope, fince it was in the last period of age that he attained the
“ knowledge of the Greek letters ⁹².”

epistle of Petrarch (Famil. ix. z.): Donasti me mutus, immo vero ego apud illum sur-
Homerum nonin alienum sermonem violento dus sum. Gaudeo tamen vel adspeftfi solo,
alveo derivatum, sed ex ipfis Graeci eloquii ac saepe illum amplexus atque suspirans dico,
