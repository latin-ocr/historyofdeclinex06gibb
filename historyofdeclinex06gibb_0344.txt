Hungary a cast of Norwegian hawks, and fix horse-loads of scarlct
eloth, of fine linen of Rheims, and of Arras tapestry‚ representing
the battles of the great Alexander. After much delay, the effe& of
distance rather than of art, Bajazet agreed to accept a ransom of
two hundred thousand ducats for the count of Nevers and the sur-
viving princes and barons: the marshal Boucicault‚ a famous warrior,
was of the number of the fortunate3 but the admiral of France had

been ssain in the battle3 and the constable, with the sire de Coucya '

died in the prison of Boursa. This heavy demand, which was
doubled by incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy,
or rather on his Flemish subjeets, who were bound by the feudal laws
to contribute for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of
their lord. For the faithful discharge of the debr, some merchants
of Genoa gave security to the amount of five times the sum3 a
leffon to those warlike times, that commerce and credit are the links
of t-he society of nations. It had,been stipulated in the treaty,
that the French captives should swear never to bear arms against the
person of their conqueror; but the ungenerous restraint was abo-

“ ambitious of effacing the disgrace or missortune of thy first chi-

“ that Bajazet will rejoice to meet thee a second time in a field of
“ battle.'’ Before their departure, they were indulged in the free-
dom and hospitality of the court of Boursa. The French princes
admired the magnificence of the Ottoman‚ whose hunting and hawk-
ing equipage was composed of seven thousand huntsmen and seven
thousand falconers⁶⁵. In their presence, and at his command, the
