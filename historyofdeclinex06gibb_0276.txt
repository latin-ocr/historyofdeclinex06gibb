was propagated, of his punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted
the lettuce of a convent garden. Driven from the throne by the
universal clamour, Athanafius composed before his retreat two papers
of a very opposite cast. His pub-lic testament was in the tone of
charity and resignation3 the private codicil breathed the direst ana-
themas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded for
ever from the communion· of the holy trinity, the angela, and the>
saints. This last paper he inclosed in an earthen pot, which was
placed, by his order, on the top of one of the pillars in the dome
of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and revenge. At
the end of four years, some youths, climbing by a ladder in search
of pigeons nests, detected the fatal secret3 and, as Andronicus felt
himself touched and bound by the excommunication, he trembled
on the brink of the abyss which had been so treacheroussy dug
under his feet. A synod of bishops was instantly convened to debate‘
this important question: the rashness of these clandestine anathemas
was generally condemned3 but as the knot could be untied only by
the same hand, as that hand was now deprived of the crosier, it‘
appeared that this posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly
power. Some faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were ex-
torted from the author of the mischief; but the conscience of the*
emperor was still wounded, and he defu-ed, with no less ardour than
Athanasius himself, the restoration of a patriarch, by whom alone
he could be healed. At the dead of night, a monk rudely knocked
at the door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of
plague and famine, of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus
'started from his bed, and spent the night in prayer, till he felt, or
thought that he felt, a ssight motion of the earth. The emperor on
foot led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius 3 and, after
a proper refistance, the saint, from whom this meffage had been sent,
consented to absolve the prince, and govern the church, of Con-

stantinople.
