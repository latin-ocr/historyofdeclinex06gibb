navy, were either sunk or taken z the enormous and massy links of
iron were cut asunder by ‘the ssmars, or broken by the weight, of the
gallies ⁶³3 and the Venetian lieet, safe and triumphant, rode at anchor
in the port of Constantinople. By these daring atchievements, a
remnant of twenty thousand Latius solicited the licence of befieging
a capital which contained above four hundred thousand inhabitants ⁶⁴,
able, though not willing, to bear arms in the defence of their coun-
