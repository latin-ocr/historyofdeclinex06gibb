These examples might be readily presumed : but the elevation of an

Hebrew race to the rank of senators and consuls, is an event with—

out a parallel in the long captivity of these miserable exiles⁹⁴. In the

time of Leo the ninth, a wealthy and learned Jew was converted

to christianity3 and honoured at his baptism with the name of his
godfather‚ the reigning pope. The zeal and eourage of Peter the Fam11y‹f

son of Leo were fignalised in the cause of Gregory the seventh‚ Leothejeffi«

¹who entrusted his faithful adherent with the government of Adrian's
mole, the tower of crescentius, or, as it is now called, the caflle of
St. Angelo. Both the father and the son were the parents of a nu-
merous progeny; their riches, the fruits of usury, were shared with
the noblest families of the city 3 and so extenfive was their alliance,
that the grandson of the proselyte was exalted by the weight of his
kindred to the throne of St. Peter. A majority of the clergy and
people supported his cause ; he reigned several years in the Vadean,
and it is only the eloquence of St. Bernard, and the final triumph os
Innocent the second, that has branded Anacletus with the epithet of
antipope. After his defeat and death, the posterity of Leo is no
longer conspicuous; and none will be found of the modern nobles
ambitious of descending from a jewish stoek. It is not rny dcfign
