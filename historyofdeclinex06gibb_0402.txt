h--w-J nople ; and Palaeologus could depend neither on himself nor on his

people. By his mother’s advice, and in the hope of foreign aid,

he abjured the rights both of the church and state; and the a& of
-ssavery ⁷, subscribed in purple ink‚ and sealed with the golden bull,

was privately intrusted to an Italian agent. The first article of the

treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the fixth and

his sueceffors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and Catholic

church. The emperor promises to entertain with due reverence

their legates and nuncios; to affign a palace for their residence and

a temple for their worship 3 and to deliver his second son Manuel as

the hostage of his faith. For these condescenfions‚ he requires a

prompt succour of fifteen gallies, with five hundred men at arms,

and a thousand archers, to serve against his Christian and Musulman

enemies. Palaeologus engages to impose on his clergy and people

the same spiritual yoke3 but as the refistance of the Greeks might

be justly foreseen‚ he adopts the two effeEfflal methods of corruption

and education. The legate was empowered to distribute the vacant

benefices among the ecclefiastics who should subscribe the creed of
the Vatican: three schools were instituted to instruet the youth of
Constantinople in the language and dodirine of the Latins; and the

name of Andronicus, the heir of the empire, was enrolled as the

first student. Should he fai] in the measures of persuafion or force,

Palaeologus declares himself unworthy to reign; transferred to the

pope all regal and paternal authority; and invests Innocent with

full power to regulate the family, the government‚ and the marriage,

of his son and successor. But this treaty was neither executed nor

published: the Roman gallies were as vain and imaginary as the ,
submiflion of the Greeks; and it was only by the secrecy, that their

sovereign escaped thc dithonour, of this fruitless humiliation-

(Hist. Eccles. p. 151-154.)‚ from Raynal— was not worth the trouble of a pious forgery..
