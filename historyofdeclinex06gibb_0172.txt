THE DECLINE AND FALL

spirit of the Varangian guards, of the Da1es and English, as they
are named in the writers of the times ⁶⁶. After ten days incefl'ant
labour, the ground was lev Med, the ditch filled, the approaches of
the besiegers were regularly made, and two hundred and fifty en-
gines of affault exercised their various powers to clear the rampart,
t'o batter the walls, and to sap the foundations. On the first appear-
ance of a breach, the scaling-ladders were applied: the numbers
that defended the vantage ground repulsed and oppreffed the adven-
turous Latin33 but they admired the resolution of fifteen knights
and serjeants‚ who had gained the astent, and maintained their
perilous station till they were precipitated or made prisoner-s by the
Imperial guards. On the fide of the harbour the naval attack was
more successfully condueted by the Venetians; and that industrious
people employed every resource that was known and praeiised be-

in from, was formed by the gallies and ffiips; and the swift motion
of the former was supported ‘by the weight and loftiness of the latter,
whose decks, and poops, and turret‚ were the platforms of military
engines, that discharged their shot over the heads of the first line. The
soldiers, who leaped from the gallies on shore, immediately planted and'
ascended their scalingdadders, while ¹the large ships, advancing more
ssowly into the intervals, and lowering a draw-bridge, opened a way
through the air from their masts to the rampart. In the midst of
the confliffi‘n the doge, a venerable and conspicuous form, stood aloft
in complete armour on the prow of his galley. The great standard
of St. Mark was displayed before him3 his threats, promises, and-
exhortations, urged the diligence of the rowers3 his veffel was the
first that struck3 and Dandolo was the first warrior on the shore*
