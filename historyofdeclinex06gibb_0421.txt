the great ecclesiarch or preacher, Sylvester Syropulus⁴⁹, has com-
posed⁵⁰ a free and curious history of ‘the fids} uni0n⁵¹. Of the
clergy that reluctant& obeyed the summons of the emperor and the
patriarch, submission was the first duty, and patience the most use-
ful virtue. In a chosen list of twenty bishops‚ we discover the me·-
tropolitan titles of Heraclea and Cyzicus, Nice and Nicomedia,
Ephesus and Trebizond, and the personal merit of Mark and Bessa-
rion, who, in the confidence of their learning and eloquence, were

promoted to the episcopal rank. Some monks and philosophers

were named to display the science and sanctity of the Greek ¹

church z and the service of the choir was performed by a sele& band
of fingers and muficians. The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and
jerusalem, appeared by their genuine or fictitious deputies ; the pri-
mate of Ruffia represented a national church‚ and the Greeks might
contend with the Latins in the extent of their spiritual empire. The

precious vases of St. Sophia were exposed to the winds and waves,
that the patriarch might officiate with becoming splendour3 whatever
gold the emperor could procure, was expended in the maisy orna-

*ὅ The reader will smile at the fimplicity
with which he imparted these hopes to his
favourites: 'rotam-m πληροφομαν exne-ew ἤλπιζε και
δία ΤΒ ΠΖἯἿΖ ielffif ἑλξῖἱθέἔωσαύ Τῇ, ἐκκλησίαν απο
της αποτεθεισης avr& δελεκις παρα τε βασιλεως
(p.9z.). Yet it would have been difficult
for him to have prassised the leffons os Gre-
gory vn.

⁴⁹ The Christian name of Sylvester is bor--
mwed from the Latin calendar. In modern
Greek, πυλος, as a diminutive, is added to
the end of words: nor can any reasoning of
Creyghton, the editor, excuse his changing
into Sguropulus (Sguros, fuscus) the Syropu-
lus of his own manuscript, whose name is
subscribed with his own hand in the ansts of
the council of Florence. Why might not

the author be of Syrian extraction ἓ

⁵⁰ From the conclusion of the history, Ι

should fix the date to the year 1444, four years
after the synod, when the great ecclesiarch

had abdicated his office (sectio x-ii. p. 330-—
350.). His passions were cooied by time and
retirement, and, although Syropulus is often
partial, he is never intemperate.

⁵¹ Vera historia unionis non verce inter Graecas
et Latinos (Hagae Comitis, 1660, in folio), was

first publilhed with a loose and florid version&

by Robert Creyghton‚chaplain to Char-les 11.
in his exile. The zeal of the editor has pre-
fixed a polemic title, sor the beginning of the
original is wanting. Syropulus may be ranlced
with the best of the Byzantii-ie writers for
the merit of his narration, and even of his
style: but he is excluded from the orthodox
collefflons of the councils.
