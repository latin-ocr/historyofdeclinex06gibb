Zara and the rapid advances of the Lat'ms3 as soon as he saw the
danger was real, he thought it inevitable5 and his vain presumption
was lost in abje& despondency and despair. He suffered these con-
temptible Barbarians to pitch their camp in the fight of the palace3
and his apprehenfions were thinly disguised by the pomp and me-

appearance of the strangers. If these pilgrims were fincere in their
vow for the deliverance of Jerusalem, his voice must applaud, and
his treasures should assist‚ their pious design3 but should they dare
to invade the san&uary of empire‚ their numbers, were they ten
times more considerable, should not prote& them from his just re-

“ young prince who is seated among us, and to his father, the em-

“ brot-her confess his guist, and implore forgiveness, and We our-
1‘ selves will intercede, thar he may be permitted to live in affluence
“ and security. But let him not insult us by a second meffage:

“ our reply will be made in arms, in the palace of Constantinople.”
