maintained the most useful and defensihle posts ; fortified the towns
and castles which he had first pillaged ; and renounced the pastoral

life for the bathe. and palaces of his infant capitals. But it was not

till Othman was opprefl'ed by age and iiiiii‘xnities, that he received the
welcorne news of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered
by famine or treachery to the arms of his son Orehan. The glory
of Othman is chiefly founded on that of his descendants; =but the

From the conquest of Prusa, we may date the true Pera of the
Ottoinan empire. The lives and poffeffions of the Christian subjefflzs

were redeemed by a tribute or ransom of thirty thousand croWns of
gold3 and the city, by the labours of Orchan, assumed the aspeffi:
of a Mahometan capital 3 Prusa was decorated with a mosch, a col-
lege, and an hospital, of royal foundati0n3 the Seljukian coin was
changed for the name and impreffion of the new dynasty: and the
most skilful professors, of human and divine knowledge, attrae‘oed
the Persian and Arabian students from the ancient schools of Orien-
ta'l learning. The office of vizir was instituted for Aladin, the
*brother of Orchan3 and a different habit distinguished the citizens
from vthe pensante, the Mossems from the infidels. All the troops of

any writers older than Mahomet II. nor can
I reach beyond a meagre chronicle (Annales
Turcici ad Annum 1550), transsated byJohn
Gaudier, and published by Leunclavius (ad
'calcem Laonic. Chalcond. p. 3¹¹-350·)⁵
with copious pandefils, or commentaries. The
History of the Growth and Decay (A.D.1300
—1683) of the Othrnan Empire, was trans-
lated into English from the Latin MS. of
‘Demetrius Cantemir, prince of Moldavia
(London‚ 1734, in folio). The author is
guilty of strange blunders in Oriental history;
but he was conversam with the language, the
aunan, and institutions of the Turks. Cante-

mir partly draws his materials from the Sy-
nopsis of Saadi Effendi of Larissa, dedicated
in the year 1696 to sultan Mustapha, and a
valuable abridgrnent of the original historiam.
In one'of the Ramblers, Dr. Johnson praises
Knolles (a General History of the Turks to
the present Year. London, 1603) as the first
of historians, unhappy only in the choice of
his subject. Yet I much doubt whether a par-
tia] and verbose compilation from Latin writers,
thirteen hundred folio pages os speeches and
battles, can either instruct or amuse an en-
lightened age, which requires from the histo-
rian some tinCture ofphilosophy and criticism.
