fiattery and gifts, to assuage an implacable foe, who fought, and
secretly fomented, the ssightest occafion of a quarrel. Such occa-
slons must soon and inevitably be found. The ruins of stately
churches, and even the marble columns which had been consecrated
to St. Michael the archangel, were employed without scruple by the
profane and rapacious Mossems3 and some Christians, who presumed .
to oppose the removal, received from their hands the crown of mar-
tyrdom. Constantine had solicited a Turkish guard to prote& the
fields and harvests of his subjeciss: the guard was fixed3 but their
first order was to allow free pasture to the mules and horses of the
camp, and to defend their brethren if they should be molested by
the natives. The retinue of an Ottoman chief had left their horses
to pass the night among the ripe corn: the damage was felt; the
insult was resented3 and several of both nations were flain in a tu-

and a detachtnent was commanded to exterminate the guilty vil- ¹

reapers were maffacred by the soldiers. Till this provocation‚ Con-
stantinople had been open to the vifits of commerce and curiosity:
on the first alarin, the gates were shut ; but the emperor, still anxious
for peace, released on the third day his Turkish captives ¹⁷5 and ex-

“ city into your hands, l‘submit without a murmur to his holy will.
“ But until the Judge of the earth shall pronounce between us, it is
“ my duty to live and die in the defencc of my people.'' The
sultan's anl'wer was hostile and decisive: his fortifications were com-
