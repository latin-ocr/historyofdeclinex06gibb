she was delivered of a son, who was named Baldwin, the last and
most unfortunate of the Latin princes of Constantinople. His birth
endeared him to the barons of Romania3 but his childhood would
have prolonged the troubles of a minority, and his claims were
superseded by the elder claims of his brethren. The first of these,
>Philip of Courtenay, who derived' from his mother the inheritance
of Namur, had the vvisdom to prefer the substance of a marquisate
to the shadow of an empire3 and on his refusal, Robert‚ the second
of the sons of Peter and Yoland, was called to the throne of Con-
stantinople. Warned by his father's mischance, he pursued his ssow
and secure journey through Germany and along the Danube: a passage
was opened by his fister's marriage with the king of Hungary ; and'
the emperor Robert was crowned by the patriarch in the cathedral of'v
S't. Sophia. But his reign was an aera of calamity and disgrace;
and the colony, as it was styled, of NEW FRANCE yielded on all
fides to the Greeks of Nice and Epirus. After a victory, which he
owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, Theodore Angelus enm ’
tered the kingdom of Thessalonica, expelled the feeble Demetrius,
the son of the marquis Boniface, erec‘oed his standard on the walls
of Adrianople3 and added, by his vanity, a third or a fourth name to
the list of ss-rival emperors. The relies of the Afiatic province were
swept away by John Vataces, the son-in-law and successor of Theo-

dore Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant reign of thirty-three years,
