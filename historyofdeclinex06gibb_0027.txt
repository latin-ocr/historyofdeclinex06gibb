disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national hostility. But the crusmes >
name and nature of an holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny;
nor can wc hastily believe, that the servants of the Prince of peace
would unlheathe the sword of destruction, unless the motive were
pure, the quarrel legitimate, and the neceffity inevitable.‘ The policy
of an action may be determined from the tardy leffons of experi-
ence3 but, before we ast, our conscience should be satisfied of the
justice and propriety of our enterprise. ’ In the age of the crusades,
the Christians‚ both of the East and West, were persuaded of their

lawfulness and merit3 their arguments are clouded by the perpetual
abuse of scripture and rhetoric ; but they seem to infist on the right
of natural and religious defence, their peculial· title to the Holy
Land, and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes ²⁰.
I.⁴ The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and spi-
ritual allies z it depends on the existence of danger ; and that danger
must be estimated by the two-sold consideration of the malice, and

the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has been imputed
to the Mahometans, the duty of extirpczthzg all other religions by
the sword. This charge of ignorance andr bigotry is refuted by the
Koran, by the history of the Musulman conquerors, and by their
public and legal toleration of the Christian worship. But it cannot

be denied, that the Oriental churches are depreffed under their iron

was unknown to a late French historian,
who has given a large and critical list of the
writers of the crusades (Esprit des croisades,
tom. i. p. 13—141.)‚ and most of whose
judgments my own experience will allow
me to ratify. It was late before I could ob-
tain a sight of the French histor-lans collected
by Duchesne. Ι. Petri Tudebodi Sacerdotis

in vii books (p. 890—912.)‚ is of small value
or account.

²⁰ If the reader will turn to the first scene
of the first part of Henry the Fourth‚ he will
see in the text of Shakspeare the natural
feelings of enthufiasm3 and in the notes of
Dr. Johnson, the workings of a bigotted
though vigorous mind, greedy of every pre-
tence to hate and persecute those who dissent
from his creed.
