But the schism of the west, and the factions and wars of France and
England, diverted the Latins from this generous enterprise: they
enjoyed the present respite, without a thought of futurity; and were
often tempted by a momentary interest, to serve the common enemy

of their religion. A colony of Genoese⁷⁶, which had been planted
at Phocaea ⁷¹ on the Ionian coast, was enriched by the lucrative mo-
nopoly of alum ⁷³ ; and their tranquillity, under the Turkiss1 empire,
was secured by the annual payment of tribute. In the last civil war
of the ottonum, the Genoese governor, Adorno, a bold and ambi-
tious youth, embraced the party of Amurath ; and undertook with
seven stout gallies to transport him from Afia to Europe. The
sultan and five hundred guards embarked on board the admiral’s
ship3 which was manned by eight hundred of the bravest Franks.
His life and liberty were in their hands; nor can we, without re-
luctance‚ applaud the fidelity of Adorno, who, in the midst of the

passage, knelt before him, and gratefully accepted a discharge of his
arrears of tribute. They lauded in fight of Mustapha and Gallipoli;

two thousand Italians, armed with lances and battle-axes, attended
Amurath to the conquest of Adrianople3 and this venal service

was soon repaid by the ruin of the commerce and colony of
Phoeaea.
