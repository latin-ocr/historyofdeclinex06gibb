THE DECLINE AND FALL

In a quarter of the city which was inhabited only by mechanica
and Jews, the marriage of an innkeeper and a waffierwoman pro-
duced the future deliverer of Rome ²⁰. From such parents Nicholas
Rienzi Gabrini could inherit neither dignity nor fortune; and the
gift of a liberal education, which they painfully bestowed, was the
cause of his glory and untimely end. The study of history and
eloquence, the writings of Cicero, Seneca, Livy, Caesar, and Va-
lerius Maximus, elevated above his equals and contemporaries the
genius of the young plebeian: he perused with indefatigable dili-
gence the manuscripts and marbles of antiquity3 loved to dispense
his knowledge in familiar language 3 and was often provoked to ex·-
claim, ‘⁶ where are now these Romans? their virtue, their justice,
‘⁴ their power? why was I not born in those happy times ²¹ ?'’
W'hen the republic addreffed to the throne of Avignon an embaffy
of the three orders, the spirit and eloquence of Rienzi recom-
mended him to a place among the thirteen deputies of the commons.
The orator had the honour of haranguing pope Clement the fixffl,
and the safisfadfion of converfing with Petrarch, a congenial mind:
but his aspiring hopes were chilled by disgrace and poverty3 and

usque ad Annum 1354, in the original dia-
1εᾶ of Rome or Naples in the xivth century,
and a Latin version for the benefitof strangers.
It contains the most particular and authentie
life of Cola (Nicholas) di Rienzi3 which had
been printed at Braeciano 1627, in 4¹⁰, under
the name of Tomaso Fordfiocca, who is only
mentioned in this work as having been pu-
nished by the tribune for forgery. Human
nature is scarcely capable of such sublime or
stupid impartiality; but whosoever is the εωω
thor of these Fragments, he wrote on the spot
and at the time, and paints, without defign
or ert, the manners of Rome and the cha-
ranei· of the tribune.

²⁰ The first and splendid period of Rienzi,
his tribunitian governmenr‚ is contained in
the xviim* chapter of the Fragments (p. 399

-479.), which, in the new division, forms ‘¹

the ii‘¹ book of the history in xxxviii smaller
chapters or sections.

²¹ The reader may be pleased with a spe-
cimen of the original idiom: F& da soa ju-
ventutine nutricato di latte de eloquentia,
bono gramatico, megliore rettuorico, au-
torista bravo. Deh como et quanto era ve-
loce leitore! moito usava Tito Livio, Seneca,
et Tullio, et Balerio Maflimo‚ moito li di-
lettava le magnificentie di Julio cesare rac-
contare. Tutta la die se speculava negl'
intagli di marmo lequali iaccio intorno Roma.
Non era altri che esso, che sapesse lejere li
antichi pataffii. Tutte scritture antiche vul-
garizzava; quefl‘e fiure di marmo justameme
interpretava. Oh come spess‘o diceva, “ Dove
‘⁸ suoco quelli buoni Romani? dove ene
’ί loro somma justitia? poleramme trovare in
tempo che queffi fiuriano ¹.''
