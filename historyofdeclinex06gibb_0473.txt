paternal treatment of GeorgeCastriot, the fourth brother, who from C H A Ρ.

his tendet youth, displayed the strength and spirit of a soldier. The
succeflive overthrow of a Tartar Jand two Perfians, who carried a

proud defiance to the Turkish court, recommended him to the favour
of Amurath‚ and his Turkistr appellation of Scanderbeg (Iskender
Beg), or the lord Alexander, is an indelible memorial of his glory
and servitude. His father’s principality was reduced into a pro-
vince : but the loss was compensated by the rank and title of Sanjiak,
a command of five thousand horse, and the prospe& of the first
dignities of the empire. He served with honour in the wars of
Europe and Afia3 and we may smile at the art or credulity of the

historian, who supposes, that in every encounter he spared the
Christians, while he fell with a thundering arm on his Musulman
foes. The glory of Huniades is without reproach3 he fought in
the defence of his religion and country3 but the enemies who *ap-
plaud the patriot, have branded his rival with the name of traitor and
apostate. In the eyes of the Christians, the rebellion of Scanderbeg is
justified by his father's wrongs, the ambiguous death of his three bro-
therS, his own degradation, and the ssavery of his country3 and they
adore the generous, though tardy,zeal, with which he asserted the saith
and independence of his ancestors. But he had imbibed from his ninth
year the do&rines of the Koran ; he was ignorant of the Gospel ; the
religion of a soldier is determined by authority and habit ; nor is it
easy to conceive what new illumination at the age of forty ³⁸ could
be poured into his soul. His motives would be less exposed to the
suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken his chain from the
moment that he was senfible of its weight : but a long oblivion had
surely impaired his original right ; and every year of obedience and
