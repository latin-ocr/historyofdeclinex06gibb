ι--Ὓ-ι adventure. The Roman ladies were marshalled in three squadrons,

>and seated in three balconies, which on this day, the third of Sep-
tember, were lined with scarlet eloth. The fair Jacova di Rovere
'led the matrons from beyond the Tyber, a pure and native racc,
who still represent the features and character of antiquity. The
remainder of the city was divided as usual between the Colonna and
Urfini: the two factions were proud of the number and beauty of
their female bands: the charms of Savella Ursmi are mentioned
with praise ; and the Colonna regretted the absence of the youngest
:of their house, who had sprained her ancle in the garden of Nero’s
tower. The lots of the champions were drawn by an old and re-
spectable citizen3 and they descended into the arena, or pit, to en-

Amidst the crowd, our annalist has selected the names, colorus, and

names are the most illustrious of Rome and the ecclefiastical state;
Malatesta, polenta, della Valle, Cafarello, Savelli, Capoccio, Comi,
Annibaldi‚ Altieri, Corfi; the colours were adapted to their taste
and fituation3 the devices are expreffive of hope or despair, and
breathe the spirit of gallantry and arms„ “ Iam alone, like the
“- youngest of the Horatii‚'’ the confidence of an intrepid stranger:
“ I live disconsolate,” a weeping widower: “ I burn under the
“ ashes‚” a discreet lover: “ I adore Lavinia, or Lucretia‚'’ the
ambiguous declaration of a modern passion: “ My saith is as pure,”
the motto of a white livery: “ Who is stronger than myself?” of
*a lion’s hide ε “ If I am drowned in blood, what a pleasant death,”
the wish of ferocious contage„ The pride or prudence of the Ursmi
restrained them from the field, which was occupied by three of
their hereditary rimls, whose inscriptio-ns denoted the lofty greatness
of the Colonna name: “ Though sad, 1 am strong:” “ Strong asI

“ am great :” “ 1f1 fall‚’' addreffing himself to the spectators, “ you
