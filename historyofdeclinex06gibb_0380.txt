362 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {Xe P. be the consequence, the word of the prince ffiould never be disputed ,

v--vssa or recalled; but his foes have malicioussy observed, that the com-
mands of anger and destruction were more striffly executed than
those of beneficence and favour. His sons and grandsons‚ of whom
Timour left fix-and-thirty at his decease, were his first and most
submiffive subjeCis3 and whenever they deviated from their duty,
they were corre&ed‚ according to the laws of Zingis, with the
bastonade‚ and afterwards restored to honour and command. Per-
haps his heart was not devoid of the social virtues; perhaps he was
not incapable of loving his friends and pardoning his enemies ; but
the rules of morality are founded on the public interest ; and it may

be sufficient to applaud the 'wffdom of a monarch, for the liberality
by which he is not impoverished, and for the justice by which he is
strengthened and enriched. To maintain the harmony of authority
and obedience, to chastise the proud, to prote& the weak, to reward
the deserving, to banilh vice and idleness from his dominions, to
secure the traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredations of the
soldier, to cherish the labours of the husbandman, to encourage in-
dustry and learning, and, by an equal and moderate affeffment, to
encrease the revenue, without encreasing the taxes, are indeed the
duties of a prince ; but, in the discharge of these duties, he finds an
ample and immediate recompense. Timour might boast, that at
his acceffion to the throne, Afia was the prey of anarchy and rapine,
whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child, fearless and unhurt,
might carry a purse of gold from the East to the West. Such was
his confidence of merit, that from this reformation he derived an
excuse for his victories, and a title to universal dominion. The four
following observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public
gratitude3 and p'erhaps we shall conclude, that the Mogul emperor
was rather the scourge than the benefactor of mankind. 1. If some
partial disorders, some local oppreffions‚ were healed by the sword
of Timour, the remedy was far more pernicious than the disease.
