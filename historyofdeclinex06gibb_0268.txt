THE· DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P for his reception, and a niece of the emperor was given in mar-

LXII.

W riage to the valiant stranger, who was immediately created great

duke 01·- admiral of Romania. After a decent repose, he transported
his troops- over the Propontis, and boldly led them against the
Turks: in two bloody battles thirty thousand of the Mossems were
ssain: he raised the siege of Philadelphia‚ and deserved the name
of the deliverer of Afia. But after a short season of prosperity‚.
