OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 505

the throne of the glory of God ⁷¹, was despoiled of the oblations of &XI-IL!
ages3 and thc gold and filver, the pearls and jewels, the vases and
sacerdotal ornaments, were most wickcdly converted to the service
of mankind. After the divine images had been stripped of all that
could be valuable to a profane eye, the canvasS, or the wood, was
torn, or broken, or burnt, or trod under foot, ror applied, in the
stables or the kitchen, to the vilest uses. The example of sacrilege
was imitated however from the Latin conquerors of Constantinople 3
and the treatment which Christ, the Virgin, and the saints, had sus-
tained from the guilty Catholic, might be inflieted hythe zealous
.Musulman on the monuments of idolatry. Perhaps, instead ofjoin-
ing the public clamour, a philosopher will observe, that in the de-
cline of the artS, the workmanship could not be more valuable than
the work, and that a fresh supply of vifions and miracles would
speedily be renewed by the craft of the priest and the credulity of
the people. He will more serioussy deplore the loss of the Byzan-
tine libraries, which were destroyed or scattered in the general con-
fufion: one hundred and twenty thousand manuscripts are said to
have disappeared⁷²3 ten volumes might be purchased for a single
ducat ; and the same ignominious price, too high perhaps for a ssoelf
of theology, included the whole works of Aristotle and Homer, the
noblcst productions of the science and literature of ancient Grecce.
We may reflec‘c with pleasure, that an inestimable portion of our
claffic treasures was safely depofited in ltaly 3 and that the mechanics
ofa German town had invented an art which derides the havock of
time and barbarism.
