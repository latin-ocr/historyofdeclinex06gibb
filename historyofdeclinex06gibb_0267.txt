was agitated by the present evil of the dilbanded armies. Too idle to u--w-J

work, too proud to beg, the mercenaries were accustomed to a life
of rapine: they could rob with more dignity and effe& under a ban-
ner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom their service was usc—
less and their presence importunam, endeavoured to discharge the
torrent on some neighbouring countries. After the peace of Sicily,
many thousands of Genoese, catalani-⁴⁷, &c. who had fought, by
sea and land, under the standard of Anjou or Arragon, were blended
into one nation by the resemblance of their manners and interest.
They heard that the Greek provinces -of Asia were invaded by the
Turks: they resolved to ssiare the harvest of pay and plunder; and
Fr—ederic king of Sicily most liberally contributed the means of their
departure. In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a camp, was
become their country; arms were their sole profeflion and property ς,
valour was the only virtue which they knew ; their women had im-
bibed the fearless temper of their lovers and husbands: it was re-
ported, that, with a stroke of their broad-swerd, the Catalans could
c-leave a horseman and an horse -; and the report itself was a power-
ful weapon. Roger de Flor was the most popular of their chiefs3
and his personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his prouder rivals
of Arragon. The offspring of a marriage between a German
gentleman of the court of Frederie the second and a damsel of
Brindisi, Roger was succeflively a templar, an apostate, a pirate, and
at ‘length the richest and most powerful adrniral of the Mediterranean.
He sailed from ‘Me‘ffina to Constantinople, with eighteen gallies, four
great ships, and eight thousand adventurers3 and his previous treaty
was faithfully accomplished by Andronicus the elder, who accepted
with joy and terror this formidable succour.. A palace was allotted

⁴⁷ In this motley multitude, the Catalans from the Goths, and Pachymer (l.xi. c. zz.)
and Spaniards, the ‘bravest of the soldiery‚ from the Arabs; andin spite of national and

were styled, by themselves and the Greeks, religious pride, 1 am afraid the latter is in the
Amogavares. Moncada derives their orig'm right.
