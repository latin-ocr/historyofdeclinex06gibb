THE DECLINE AND FALL

nity; and thus, in the ardour of youth, Ι communed with my

h--v-—a “ own mind—wilt thou be wanting to thyself and thy fortune?

“ Wilt thou refuse to be introduced to a familiar converse with
‘² Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes? with those poets, philosophers,
“land orators‚ of whom such wonders are related, and who are
“ celebrated by every age as the great masters of human science?
“ Of profeffors and scholars in civil law, a sufficient supply will al-
“ ways be found in our univerfities ; but a teacher, and such a
‘⁸ teacher, of the Greek language, if he once be suffered to escape, -
“ may never afterwards be retrieved. Convinced by these reasons,
“ Ι gave myself to Chrysoloras; and so strong was my paffion‚ that

-“ the leffons which I had imbibed in the day were the constant sub-

“ je& of my nightly dreams ⁹⁹.” At the same time and place, the
Latin claffies were explained by John of Ravenna, the domestic pupil
of Petrarch¹002 the Italians, who illustrated their age and country,
were formed in this double school ; and Florence became the fruitful
seminary of Greek and Roman eruditiori ¹⁰¹. The presence of the
emperor recalled Chrysoloras from the college to the court; but he

afterwards taught at Pavia and Rome with equal industry and ap-
plause. The remainder of his life, about fifteen years, was divided
between Italy and Constantinople, between embaffies and leffons.
In the noble office of enlightening a foreign nation, the grammarian
was not unmindful of a more sacred duty to his prince and country3

and Emanuel Chrysoloras died at Constance on a public miflion from l
the emperor to the council.
