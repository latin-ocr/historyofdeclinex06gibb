served without pay and fought without discipline: but a regular
body of infantry was first established and trained by the prudence of

disposed Orchan to educate his young captives as his soldiers and
those of the prophet ; but the Turkish peasants were still allowed to
mount on horseback, and follow his standard, with the appellation
and the hopes of fieebooters. By these arts he formed an army of

twenty-five thousand Mossems: a train of battering engines was
framed for the use of fieges ; and the first successful experiment was
made on the cities of Nice and Nicomedia. Orchan granted a safe-

and effects ; but the widows o’f the ssain were given in marriage to
the conquerors; and the sacrilegious plunder‚ the books, the vases‚

men. Their dominions were fituate in the heart of the Seljukian
