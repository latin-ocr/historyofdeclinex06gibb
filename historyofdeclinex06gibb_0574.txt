THE DECLINE AND FALL

The cardinals of both parties-

*w were soon astonished by a summons to attend him beyond the Alps 3v

from whence, as they soon discovered, they must never hope to re-
turn. He was engaged, by promise and affection, to prefer the
residence of France3 and, after dragging his court through Poitou
and Gascogny, and devouring‚ by his expence, the cities and con-
vents on the road, he finally reposed at Avignon ⁸⁰, which flourished
above seventy year-3⁸¹ the seat of the Roman pontiff and the metro-
polis of Christendom. By land, by sea, by the Rhone‚ the position
of Avignon was on all fides accessible: the southern provinces of
France do not yield to Italy itself3 new palaces arose for the accom-
modation of the pope and cardina1s3 and the arts of luxury were
soon attra&ed by the treasures of the church. They were already
poss'effed of the adjacent territory, the Venaiffin county²², a popu-
lous and fertile spot; and the sovereignty of Avignon was after-

wards purchased from the youth and distress of Jane, the first queen
of Naples and countess of Provence, for the inadequate price of
fourscore thousand florinsffi. Under the ssiadow of the French mo-

narchy,

⁷9 See in the Chronicle of Giovanni Vil- judgment of Muratori, are gravely refuted
lani (1. viii. ct 63, 64. 80. in Muratori‚ in Baluze’s prefdce. The abbe de Sade is
tom. xiii.) theimprisonmentof BonifaceVIII· distraeted between the love of Petrarch and*

and the electiori* of clement V. the last of of his country.

Yet he modestly pleads, ’

which, like most an'2d0tes, is embarraffed
with some difficulties.

‘³⁰ The original lives of the eight popes of
Avignon, Clement V. John XXII. Bene-
diaxn. ClementVI. InnocentVI. Urban V.
Gregory Xl. and Clement VII. are publish-
ed by Stephen Baluze (Vitae Paparum Aveni-
onensiurn; Paris, 1693, zvols. in 4‘0) with
copious and elaborate notes, and a second
volume of aas and documents. With the
true zea} of an editor and a patriot, he de-
voutly justifies or excuses the characters of his
countrymen.

⁸¹ The exile of Avignon is compared by
the ltalians with Babylon, and the Babylonish
captivity. Such furious metaphors‚ more
suitable to the ardour of Petrarch than to the

that many of the local inconveniencia of
Avignon are now removed; and many of the
vices against which the poet declaims‚ had
been imported with the Roman court by the
strangers of Italy (tom. i. p. 23-28.).
⁸² The comtat Venaiffin was ceded to the
popes in ¹273 by Philip 111. king of Franco,
after ‚he had inherited the dominions of the
count of Tholouse. Forty years before, the
heresy of count Raymopd had given them a
pretence of seizure, and they derived some
obscure claim frorn the xi¹²¹ century to some
lands citra Rhodanum (Valefii Notitia Gal-
liarum, p. 459. 610. Longuerue, Descrip-
tion dela France, tom. i. p. 376—381.).
³³ lfa poss'effion of four centuries were not
itself a title, such objections might annul the
bargain ς
