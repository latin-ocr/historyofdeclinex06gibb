THE DECLINE AND FALL

obstinato contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the
obstinaey of the people, the craggy ground that might supersede the
neceffity of fortifications, and the walls and towers that would‘have
fortified the most aeceflible plain ¹⁰⁵. These obstacles were diminissied
in the age of the crusades. The bulwarks had been completely de·
stroycd and imperfeffly restored: the Jews, their nation and wor-
ship, were for ever baniihed5 but nature is less changeable than
man, and the fite of Jerusalem, though somewhat sofrened and some-
what removed, was still strong against the affaults of an enemy.v
By the experienee of a recent siege and a three years POffeffi0n‚ the
Saracens of Egypt had been taught to discern, and in some degree
to remedy, the defeets of a place, which religion as well as honour
forbade them to resign. Aladin or Iftikhar, the caliph's lieutenant,
was entrusted with the defence : his policy strove to resti-ain the na-
tive Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the holy
sepulchre ; to animate the Mossems by the affurance of temporat
and eterna} rewards. His garrison is said to have confisted of forty
thousand Turks and Arabians 3 and if he could muster twenty thou-
sand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged were
more numerous than the befieging army ¹⁰⁶. Had the diminished
strength and numbers of the Latina allowed thern to grasp the whole
circumference of four thousand yards (about two English miles

and an half ¹⁰⁷), to what useful purpose should they have descended

¹0⁵ See the masterly description of Tacitus
(Hist. v. 11, 12, 13.), who supposes, that
the Jewish lawgivers had provided for a per-
petigal state of hostility agai-nst the rest of man-

¹0⁶ The lively scepticism of Voltaire is
balanced with sense and eruditiori by the
French author of the Esprit des croisades
(tom. iv. p. 386-388.), who observes, that
according to the Arabians, the inhabitants
of Jerusalem must have exeeeded 200,000;
that in the siege of Titus, josephus collects
1‚300,000 Jews3 that they are stated by Ta„

citus himself at 600,000‚ and that the largest
defalcation, that his accepimus can justify,
will still leave thern more numerous than the
Roman army.

¹0⁷ Maundrell, who diligently perambu-
lated the walls, found a circuit of 4630
paces, or 4167 English yards (p. 109, 110.):
from an authentic plan, d’Anville concludes
a measure nearly similar of 1960 French tofis
(p. 23—29.)‚ in his scarce and valuable
tract. For the topography of Jerusalem, see
Rcland (palestina, tom. ii. p. 832-860.).
