O‘F THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ²79

the Qietists as the pure and perfect effence of God himself ; and as C &0341 Ρ.
long as the folly was confined to mount Athos, the simple solitaries fl--v-—J
were not inquifitive how the divine effence could be a material
substance, or how an immaterial substance could be perceived by the
eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus,
these monasteries were visited by Barlaam ⁴¹, a Calabrian monk, who
was equally sszilled in philosophy and theology ; who poffeffed the
languages of the Greeks and Latius3 and whose versatile genius
could maintain their oppofite creeds, according to the interest of the
moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the curious
traveller the secrets of mental prayer ; and Barlaam embraced the
opportunity ‘of ridiculing the Qietists‚ who placed the soul in the

nave13 of accusmg the monks of mount Athos of heresy and blas*
phemy. His attack compelled the more learned to renounce or
diffemble the simple devotion of their brethren 3 and Gregory Pala-
mas introduced a scholastic distinction between the effence and ope-
ration of God. His inacceffible effence dwells in the midst of an
uncreated and eternal light 3 and this beatific vision of the.saints had
been manifested to the disciples on mount Thabor‚,in the trans-
figuration of Christ. Yet this distinction could not escape the re-.
proach of polytheism ; the eternity of the light of Thabor was
fiercely denied ς and Barlaam still charged the Palamites with hold-
i'ng two eternal substances, a vifible and an invisible God. From
the rage of the monks of mount Athos, who threatened his life,.
the Calabrian retired to Constantinople, where his smooth and spe-
c-ious manners introduced him to the favour of the great domestic·
and the emperor. The court and the city were involved in this*
theological dispute, which flamed amidst the civil war3 but the
