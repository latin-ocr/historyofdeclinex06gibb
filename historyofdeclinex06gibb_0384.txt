n--v-LA courage was softened by clemency 3 but it was likewise inflamed by
presumption, and corrupted by intemperanee and idleness. He re-
laxed the nerves of discipline, in a government where either the
subje& or the sovereign must continually tremble: his vices alienated
the chiefs of the army and the law3 and his daily drunkenness, so

,contemptibIe in a prince and a man, was doubly odious in a disciple

«of tbe prophet. In the ssumber of intoxication‚ he was surprised

by his brother Mousa3 and as he fied from Adrianople towards

the Byzantine capital, Soliman was overtaken and ssain in a bath,

kingdom of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit‚ nor could

his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and
veteran bands of the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise

Morea ; but Mousa was ruined by his timorous dispofition and un-
seasonable clemency. After refigning the sovereignty of Anatolia,

he fell a viCffim to the perfidy of his ministers, and the superior as-

government of Amafia, thirty days Journey from Constantinople,

and the Turkish frontier against the Christians of Trebizond and

Georgia. The castle, in Afiatic warfare, was esteemed impregnable3

and the city of Amafia⁷⁴‚ which is equally divided by the river Iris,
