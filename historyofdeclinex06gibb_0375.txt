OF 'THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

From the Irtilh and Volga to the Pcrfian Gulf, and from the
Ganges to Damascus and the Archipelago‚ Asia* was in the hand of
Timou1·; his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundlesS,
and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the Christian king-
doms of the West, Which already trembled at his name. He
touched the utmost verge of the land ; but an insuperable, though
narmw, sea rolled between the two continents of Europe and
Afia⁹⁵3 and the lord of so many tomam, or myriads, of horse, was
, not master ofafingle galley. The two paffages ofthe Bosphorus and
Hellespont, of Constantinople and Gallip01i‚ were possessed, the one
by the Christians, the other by the Turks. On this great occasion,
they forgot the differenee of religion to a& with union and firm-
iness in the common cause: the double streights were guarded
with ships and fortifications3 and they separately withheld the trans-

ports‚ which Timour demanded of either nation, under the pretence>

of attacking their enemy. At the same time, they soothed his pride

with tributary gifts and suppliant embaffies, and prudently tempted
him to retreat with the honours of victory. Solimaxn the son of
Bajazet, implored his clemency for his father and himself3 accepted,
by a red patent, the investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which
he already held by the sword3 and reiterated his ardent wish, of
casting himself in person at the feet of the king of the world. The
Greek emperor ⁶⁰ (either John or Manuel) submitted to pay the
same tribute which he had stipulated with the Turkish fustan, and
ratified the treaty by an oath of allegiance, from which he could
absolve his conscience so soon as the Mogul arms had retired from

Turks, Greeks, and Arabiam. The Spanish the title of ‘Hk-kur, which is derived by cor-
ambass'ador mentions this hostile union of the ruption from the genitive τε πυμε (Cantemir,
