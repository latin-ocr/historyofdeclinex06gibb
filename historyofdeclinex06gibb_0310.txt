⁷ In the year ¹²94· by the command of
cozan, khan of Persm, the fourth in de-
scent from Zingis. From these traditions,
his vizir Fad'lallah composed a Mogul history
in the Persian language‚ which has been
used by Petit de la Croix (Hist. de Genghiz-
can, p. 537—539.). The Histoire Genealo-
gique des Tatars (1 Leyde, 1726, in 12m0,
2 tornes) was transsated by tlie Swedish
prisoners in Siberin from the Mogul MS. of
Abulgasi Bahadur Rham, a descendant of
Zingis, who reigned over the Usbeks of Cha-
rasm, or Carizme (A. D. 161ΐ Ai—1663). He
is of most value and credit for the names
pedigmes, and manners of his nation. Of
his nine parts, the i⁵² descends from Adam
to Mogul Rham the iid, from Mogul to
Zingis; the ind, is the life of Zingis3 the

of his four sons, and their posterity; the viiith

scendants of Sheibani Khan, who reigned in
Maurenahar and Charasm.

par M. Petis de la Croix, ὲ Paris, 1710,
in 121120: a work often years labour, chiefly
drawn from the Persian writers, among whom
Nisavi, the secretary of sultan Gelaleddin,
has the merit and prejudices of a contem-
porary, A ssight air of romance is the fault
of the originals, or the compilet. See like-

Syriae writing3‚ and the lives of the Jacobite
maphrians‚ or primates of the East.

¹² Among the Arabians, in language and
religion, we may distinguish Abulfeda‚ sultan
of Hamah· in Syria, who fought in person,
under the Mamaluke standard, against tho
Moguls.

felt the neceffity of connefflng. the Scythiam,

and Byzantine histories. He describes with

truth and elegante the settlement and man-.
ners of the Moguls of Perfia, buthe isiguo-v

rant of their origin, and corrupts the names
of Zingis and his sons.
