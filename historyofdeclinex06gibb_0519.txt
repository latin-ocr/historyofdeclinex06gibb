OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 501

quil ssumber. On the affuranee of the public calamity, the houses C Lfgvffi Ρ·

and convents were instantly deserted; and the trembling inhabitants ι--ν-ι
flocked together in the streets, like an hercl of timid animals; as if
accumulated weakness could be produffive of strength, or in the vain
hope, that amid the crowd, each individual might be safe and invi-
fible. From every part of the capital, they flowed into the church

of St. Sophia: in the space of an hour, the sandhury, the choir, the ,
nave, the upper and lower galleries, were filled with- the multitudes

of fathers and husbands, of women and children, of priests, monks,
and religious virgins ι the doors were barred on the infide, and they
fought prote&i0n from the sacred dome, which they had so lately
abhorred as aprofane and polluted edifice. Their confidence was
founded on the prophecy of an· enthusiast or impostor3 that one day
the Turks would enter Constantinople, and pursue the Romans as
far as the column of Constantine iu the square before St. Sophia : but
that this would be the term of their calamities ε that an angel would
descend from heaven, with a sword in his hand, and would deliver

the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor man seated at the
foot of the column. “ Take this sword,” would he say, “ and
“ avenge the people of the Lord.” At these animating words, the
Turks would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans would drive
them from the West, and from all Anatolia, as far as the frontiers
of Persia. lt is on this occafion‚ that Ducas, with some fancy and·
much truth, upbraids the discord and obstinacy of the Greeks.
“ Had that angel appeared,” exclaims the historian, “ had he offered
*“ to exterminate your foes if you would consent to the union of
“ the church, even then, in th-at fatal moment, you would have re-
“ jecced your safety or have deceived your G0d⁶⁵.”

⁶⁵ This lively description is extrafied srom subdued in 1463 (Phranza, 1 iii. c. 27.),
Dueas (c. 39.)‚ who two years afterwards that issand must have been full of the fugitives
was sent ambaffador from the prinee of Les· of Constantinople, who delighted to repeat,
Ι ‘ons to the sultan (c.44.). Till Lesbos was perhaps to adorn, the tale of their misery.
