OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

sented to ascend the ecclefiastical throne os Constantinoplc, and to
preside in the restorafion of the church. His pious simplieity was
long deceived by the arts of Palaeologus3 and his patience aud sub-
miffion might soothe the usurper and prote& the safety of the young
prince. On the news of his inhuman treatment, the patriarch un-
{heathed the spiritual sword 3 and superstition, on this occasion, was
enlisted· in the cause of humanity and justice. In a synod'of bithops,
who were stimulated by the example of his zeal‚ the patriarch pro-
nounced a sentence of excommunication3 though his prudence still

repeated the name of Michael in the public prayers. The eastern Α

prelates had not adopted the dangerous maxims of ancient Rome3
nor did they presume to enforce theircensures, by deposmg princes,
or absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance. But the Chris-
tian, who had been separated from God and the church, became an
objecit of horror ; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital, that horror
might arm the hand of an affaffin, or inflame a sedition of the
people. Palaeologus felt his danger, confeffed his guilt, and depre-
cated his judge: the a& was irretrievable3 the prize was obtained ς
and the most rigorous penance, which he solicited, would have
raised the smner to the reputation of a saint. The unrelenting pa-
triarch refused to announce any means of atonement or any hopes
of mercy 3 and condescended only to pronounce, that, for so great a
crime, great indeed must be the satisfaffion. “ Do you require‚”
said Michael‚ “ thatI should abdicate the empire ?” And at these
words, he offered, or seemed to offer, the sword of state. Arsenius
eagerly grasped this pledge of sovereignty ; but when he pereeived
that the emperor was unwilling to purchase absolution at so dear a
rate, he indignantly escaped to his cell, and left the royal smner
kneeling and weeping before the door ²¹². ⁴
