posed in his own palace to the double shame of being defirous, and u-v-„e

of being unable, to prote& a criminal. A mule, with a jar of 011,

had been stolen near Capranica 3 and the lord, of the Ursini family, ·'

was condemned to restore the damage, and to discharge a fine of
four hundred florins for his negligenee in guarding the highways.
Nor were the persons of the barons more inviolate than their lands
or houses: and either from accident or defign, the same impartial
rigour was exercised against the heads of the adverse faelions. Peter
Agapet Colonna‚ who had himself been senator of Rome, was ar-
rested in the street for injury or debt; and justice was appeased by
the tardy execution of Martin Ursmi, who, among his various ansts
of violence and rapine, had pillaged a shipwrecked veffel at the
mouth of the Tyber²⁵. His name, the purple of two cardinals, his
uncles, a recent marriage, and a mortal disease, were disregarded
by the inflexible tribune, who had chosen his vistim. The public
Officers dragged him from his palace and nuptial bed ε his trial was
short and satisfac'tory: the bell of the Capitol convened the people:
stript of his mantle, on his knees, with his hands bound behind his
back, he heard the sentence of death3 and after a brief confeffion,
Ursmi was led away to the gallows. After such an example, none
who were conscious of guilt could hope for impunity, and the ssight
of the wicked, the licentious, and the idle, soon purified the city
and territory of Rome. In this time (says the historian) the woods
began to rejoice that they were no longer infested with robber53
