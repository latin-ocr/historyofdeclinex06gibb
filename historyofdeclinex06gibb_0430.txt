the pope should furnish ten gallies for a year, or twenty for fix
months; and that he should powerfully solicit the princes of Europe,
if the emperor had occasion for land-forces.

The same year, and almost the same day, were marked by the
depofition of Eugenius at Bafi13 and, at Florence‚ by his re—union
of the Greeks and Latins. In the former synod (which he styled
indeed an affembly of daemons), the pope was branded with the
guilt of fimony, perjury, tyranny, heresy, and schism ⁷⁰ ; and de·-
clared to be incorrigible in his vices, unworthy of any title, and in-
capable of holding anyeccleslastical office. In the latter, he was re-
vered as the true and holy vicar of Christ, who, after a separation·

,of fix hundred years, had reconciled the Catholics of the East ands

West‚ in one fold, and under one ffiepherd. The a& of union was
subscribed by the pope, the emperor, and the principal members of
both churches; even by those who, like Syropulus⁷¹, had been de-
prived of the right of voting. Two copies might have sufficed for
the East and West; but Eugenius was not satisfied, unless four au-
thentic and fimilar transcripts were figned and attested as the monu-
