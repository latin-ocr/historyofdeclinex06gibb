THE DECLINE AND FALL

It was only in the age of chivalry, that valour could ascend from i
a private station to the thrones of Jerusalem and Constantinople.
The titular kingdom of Jerusalem had devolved to Mary, the
daughter of Isabella and Conrad of Montferrat‚ and the grand-
daughter of Almeric or Amaury. She was given to John of Brienne,
of a noble family in Champagne‚ by the public voice, and the judg-
ment of Philip Augustus, who named him as the most worthy cham-
pion of the Holy Land ⁴⁰. In the fifth crusade, he led an hundred
thousand Latius to the conquest of Egypt3 by him the siege of Da-
mietta was atchieved3 and the subsequent failure was justly ascribed
to the pride and avarice of the legate. After the marriage of his
daughter with Frederic the second⁴¹, he was provoked by the em-
peror's ingratitude to accept the command of the army of the church ς.
and though advanced in life and despoiled of royahy, the sword
and spirit of John of Brienne were still ready for the service of
Christendom. In the seven years of his brother's reign, Baldwin of
Courtenay had not emerged from a state of childhood‚ and the
barons of Romania felt the strong neceffity of placing the sceptre in
the hands of a man and an hero. The veteran king of Jerusalem
might have disdained the name and office of regent3 they agreed to
invest him for his life with the title and prerogatives of emperor, on
the sole condition, that Baldwin should marry his second· daughter3
and succeed at a mature age to the throne of Constantinople· The
expediation, both of the Greeks and Latius, was kindled by the re-
nown, the choice‚ and the presence of John of Brienne: and they
admired his martial aspect, his green and vigorous age of more than
fourscore years, and his fize and stature, which surpaffed the com-
