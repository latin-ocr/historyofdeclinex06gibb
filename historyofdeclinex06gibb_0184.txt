166 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ῙῖΧΑ P· the stranger3‚ but by the Latins‚ who had been driven from the

b--v-L-a city, and who exercised the revenge of a triumphant faetion. Yet
of these exiles, some were less mindful of injuries than of benefits;
and Nicetas himself was indebted for his safety to the generosity of

a Venetian merchant. Pope Innocent the third accuses the pilgrims
of respeefing, in their lust, neither age nor sex, nor religious pro-
feffion3 and bitterly laments that the deeds of darkness, fornication,
adultery, and incest, were perpetrated in open ¹day3 and that noble
matrons and holy nuns were polluted by the grooms and peasants
of the Catholic camp⁸⁶. It is indeed probable that the licence of
vietory prompted and covered a multitude of fins : but it is certain,
that the capital of the East contained a stock of venal or willing
beauty, sufficient to satiate the desire-s of twenty thousand pilgrims;
and female prisoners were no longer subjeffi‘t to the right or qbuse of
domestic ssavery. The marquis of Montferrat was the patron of
discipline and decency3 the count of Flanders was the mirrour of
chastity: they had forbidden, under pain of death, the rape of mar-
ried women, 'or virgins, or nuns3 and the proclamation was some-
times invoked by the vanquissied⁸⁷ and respee'ced by the vietors.
Their cruelty and lust were moderated by the authority of the chiefs,
and feelings of the soldiers; for we are no longer describing aniir-
ruption of the northern savages; and however ferocious they might
still appear, time, policy, and religion, had civilized the manners of
the French‚ and still more of the Italians. But a free scope was

allowed to their avarice, which was glutted, even in the holy week,

by the pillage of Constantinople.
