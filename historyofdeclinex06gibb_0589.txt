loved a country by whose liberal spirit he had been crovvned and
adopted. The poverty and debasement of Rome excited the indig-
nation and pity of her grateful son: he diffembled the faults of his
fellow-citize1183 applauded with partial fondness the last of their
heroes and matrons; and in the remembrance of the past, in the
hope of the future, was pleased to forget the miseries of the present
time. Rome was still the lavvful mistress of the world: the pope
and the emperor, her bissmp and general, had abdicated their station

by an inglorious retreat to the Rhone and the Danube3 but if {he
could resume her virtue, the republie might again vindicate her
liberty and dominion. Amidst the indulgence of enthufiasm and
eloquence ¹⁵, Petramh, Italy, and Europe, were astonished by a revo-
lution which realized for a moment his most splendid vifions. The
rise and fall of the tribune Rienzi will occupy the following pages¹⁶:
the subje& is interesting, the materials are rich, and the glance of a
patriot-bard¹⁷ will sometimes vivify the copious, but simple, narrative

of the Florentine ¹⁸, and more especially of the Roman ¹⁹, historian.

¹⁵ To find the proofs of his enthufiasm sor
Rome, I need only request that the reader
would open, by chance, either Petrai-ch, or
his French biographer. The latter has de-

” scribed the poet’s first visit to Rome (tom. i.

p. 323—335.). But in the place of much
idle rhetoric and morality‚ Petrarch might
have amused the present and future age with
an original account of the city and his coro-
namon.

suit, the P. du Cerqeau, whose posthumous
work (Conjuration de Nicolas Gabrini, dit de
Rienzi 'Pyran de Rome, en 1347) was pub-
lished at Paris 1748, in›12¹”⁰. I am indebted
to him for some fausts and documents in John
Hocsemffls, canon of Liege, a contemporary

might treat, as his proper subjeft, a revolu-
tion in which the heart of Petrarch was so
deeply engaged (MemoireS, tom. ii. p. 50,
5¹· 320—417. notes, p. 70—76. tom. iii.
p. ezr—243. 366—375.). Not an idea or a
fa& in the writings of Petrarch has probably
escaped him.
