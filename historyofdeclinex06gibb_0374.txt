rians, who cannot stigmatize the Tartar without uncovering the
shame of their king and country.

From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion
may be deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully ⁵
described the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror,
whose spirits were harmonised by success, affected the charaeter of
generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseason-
able arrogance of Bajazet3 the complaints of his enemies‚ the Ana-
tolian princes, were just and vehement3 and Timour betrayed a
design of leading his royal captive in triumph to Samarcand. An
attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a mine under the tent,
provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint3 and
in his perpetual marehes, an iron cage on a waggon might be
invented, not as a wanton insuit, but as a rigorous precaution-
Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one
of his predeceffol‘s‚ a king of Perfia3 and Bajazet was condemned
to represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman
Caesar ⁵⁸. But the strength of his mind and body fainted under the
trial, and his premature death might, without injustice, be ascribed to
the severity of Timour. He warred not with the dead3 a tear and ase-
pulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered
from his power3 and if Mousa‚ the son of Bajazet‚ was permitted

to reign over the ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province
of Anatolia had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful so-
vereigns.
