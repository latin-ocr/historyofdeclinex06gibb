knowledge, and even the praestice, of their ancestors. A vieious pro· s--ssv--ae
nunciation¹⁰⁷, which they introduced, was banished from the schools
by the reason of the succeeding age. Of the power of the Greek

accents they were ignorant: and those musical notes, which, from
an Attic tongue, and to an Atticear, must have been the secret foul

and unmeaning marks3 in prose superfluous, and troublesome in

ments of Apollonius and Herodian were transfused into thei-r les-
sons; and their treatises of syntax and etymology, though devoid of
thlosophic spirit, are still useful to the Greek student. ln the ship-
wreck of the Byzantine libraries, each fugitive seized a fragment of
