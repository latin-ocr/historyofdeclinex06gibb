Andronicus advanced in the years of manhood, he began to feel and
to ac't for himself3 and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than
checked by the imitation of his father's vices. If we may trust his own
professions, Cantacuzene laboured with honest industry to corre& these
sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the mind of the young prince
to a level with his fortune. In the Servian expedition, the two em-
perors thewed themselves in eordial harmony to the troops and
provinces; and the younger colleague was initiated by the elder

Constantinople, and to* withdraw his youth from the temptatione
of a luxurious capital. But the distance weakened the powers of

the voyage of Thessalonica, and the office of mediation: she re-
turned without success ; and unless Anne of Savoy was instrueted by

hand, {he had been instrueted to declare, that the ten years ofhis legal
administration would soon elapse3 and that after a full trial of the
vanity of the world, the emperor Cantacuzene sighed for the repose
ofa cloyster, and was ambitious only of an heavenly crown. Had
these sentiments been genuine, his voluntary abdication would have
restored the peace of the empire, and his conscience would have
been relieved by an a& of justice. Palaeologus alone was responsible
for his future government3 and whatever might be his vices, they
