his fist a live pheasant, which, according to the rites of chivalry, he
presented to the duke. At this extraordinary summons, Philip, a
wisc and aged prince, engaged his person and powers in the holy
war against the Turks: his example was imitated by the barons
and knights of the affembly; they swore to God, the Virgin, the
ladies, and the pheastmt ; and their particular vows were not less ex-
travagant than the general sanetion of their oath. But the perform-

and, during twelve years, till the last hour of his life, the duke of
Burgundy might be scrupuloussy‚ and perhaps fincerely, on the eve
of his departure. Had every breast glowed with the same ardourg
had the union of the ChristIans corresponded with their bravery ;
had every country, from Sweden⁹⁴ to Naples, supplied a just pro-
portion of cavalry and infantry, of men and money, it is indeed
probable that Constantinople would have been delivered, and that
the Turks might have been chased beyond the Hellespont or the
Euphrates. But the secretary of the emperor, who composed every
epistle‚ and attended every meeting, AEneas Sylvius ⁹⁵, a statesman
and orator, describes from his own experience the repugnant state
and spirit of Christendom. “It is a body,” says he, “ without an
