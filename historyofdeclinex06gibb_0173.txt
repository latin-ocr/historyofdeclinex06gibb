an invisible hand (for the standard-bearer was probably ssain), the h-—v—-J

banner of the republic was fixed on the rampart: twenty-five towers
were rapidly occupied3 and, by the crucl expedient of fire, the
Greeks were driven from the adjacent quarter. The doge had dis-
patched the intelligence of his success, when he was checked by the
danger of his confederates. Nobly declaring that he would rather
die with the pilgrims than gain a victory by their destruction, Dan-
dolo relinquished his advantage, recalled his troops, and hastened to
the scene of action. He found the fix weary diminutive battles of
the French encompaffed by sixty squadrons of the Greek cavalry,
the least of which was more numerous than the largest of their di-
vifions. Shame and despair had provoked Alexius to the last effort
of a general sally3 buthe was awed by the firm order and manly
aspect of the Latins3 and, after sszirmishing at a distance, withdrew
his troops in the close of the evening. The silence or tumult of the
night exasperated his fears; and the timid usurper, collecting a
treasure of ten thousand pounds of gold, basely deserted his wife, his
people, and his fortune ; threw himself into a bark, stole through
the Bosphorus, and landcd in shameful safety in an obscure harbour
of Thrace. As soon as they were apprised of his ssight, the Greek
nobles fought pardon and peace in the dungeon where the blind
Isaac expected each hour the visit of the executioner. Again saved
and exalted by the viciffitudes of fortune, the captive in his Impe-
rial robes was replaced on the throne, and surrounded with pro-
strate ssaves, whose real terror and affected joy he was incapable
of discerning. At the dawn of day, hostilitics were suspended ;
and the Latin chiefs were surprised by a message from the lawful
and reigning emperor, who was impatient to embrace his son and

to reward his generous deliverers ⁶⁷.
