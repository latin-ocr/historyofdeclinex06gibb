THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {ID} P dem tl of sadsfadfion justified the arms of the sultan Khalil. He
μων-..ι marched against Aere, at the head of sixty thousand horse and one

hundred and forty thousand foot: his train of artill ery (ifI may
use the word) was numerous and weighty3 the separate timbers of
a single engine were transported in one hundred waggons; and the
royal historian Abulfeda, who served with the troops of Hamah,
was 'himself a speffilator of the holy war. VVhatever might be the
vices of the Franks, their courage was rekindled by enthufiasm and
despair3 but they were torn by the discord of seventeen chiefs, and
overwhelmed on all fides by the powers of the sultan. After a siege

e of thirty-three days, the double wall was forced by the Mossem53

¹² ’ the principa] tower yielded to their engines ; the Mamalukes made a

general affault ; the city was stormed ; and death or ssavery was the
lot of fixty thousand Christians. The convent, or rather fortress, of

the Templars refisted three days longer; but the great master was ’

pierced with an arrow 3 and, of five hundred knights, only ten were
left alive, less happy than the victims of the sword, if they lived to
suffer on a scaffold in the unjust and cruel proscription of the whole
order. The king of Jerusalem, the patriarch, and the great master
of the hospital, effected their retreat to the ssiore3 but the sea was
rough ; the veffels were insufficient3 and great numbers of the fugi-
tives were drowned before they could reach the isse of Cyprus, which
might comfort Lusignan for the loss of Palestine. By the command
of the sultan, the churches and fortifications of the Latin cities were
demolished: a motive of avarice or fear still opened the holy se-
pulchre to some devout and defenceless pilgrims; and a mournful
and solitary silence prevailed along the coast which had so long re-
founded with the WORLD'S DEBATE ¹⁰⁹.
