10 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C gns} Ρ· Ῡῡῖῑθί that, 111 peace and war, they affert a divine and indefeafible

μ-ψ-...ι claim of universal e1npire3 and that, in their orthodox creed, the
unbelieving nations are continually threatened with the loss of reli-
gion or liberty. In the eleventh century, the victorious arms of the
Tui-ks presented a real and urgent apprehension of these losses. They
had subdued in less than thirty years the kingdoms of Asta, as far as
Jerusalem and the Hellespont3 aud the Greek empire tottered on
the verge of destruction. Befides an honest sympathy for their bre-

and the sanctity of Palestine,have been abolished with the Mosaic law;
that the God of the Christians is not a local deity, and that the re-
covery of Bethlem or Calvary, his cradle or his tomb‚ will not
atone for the violation of the moral precepts of the gospel. Such ar-
guments glance aslde from the leaden ssiield of superstition ; and the
religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred ground
of mystery and miracle. ΙΙΙ. But the holy wars which have been
waged in every climate of the globe‚ from Egypt to Livonia, and
from Peru to Hindostan‚ require the support os some more general

and flexible tenet. It has been often supposed, ancl sometimes af-
